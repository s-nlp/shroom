Consumers are not so stupid that they cannot obtain information unless we prescribe labels for them to read.,Consumers possess the intelligence to gather information without the need for mandatory labels.,1
We should not think of consumers as beings that we alone can release from ignorance.,We shouldn’t see consumers as individuals whose unawareness can only be addressed by us.,1

In the light of this advice we will then decide the content of a proposal for a directive based on Article 141.,"Following this advice, the details of a directive proposal under Article 141 will be determined.",1

Amendment of the Rules of Procedure,Modification to the procedural rules,1
I would inform the House that Mr Crowley has endorsed the minority opinion which is set out in the explanatory statement.,I wish to notify the House that [Name0] [Surname1] has supported the minority view detailed in the explanatory report.,1
I give the floor to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy for a procedural motion.,I will now let Mr Fabre-Aubrespy speak for a procedural motion.,1
I am disputing the debate on this text on two essential grounds.,I have two fundamental objections to the debate surrounding this text.,1
"However, clearly none of the Member States has yet exchanged instruments of ratification, to put it in diplomatic terms.","None of the Member States has exchanged their instruments of ratification, speaking diplomatically.",1
In my minority opinion which I submitted on this text I list the points where I think the report goes too far.,"In the dissenting view I presented on this document, I highlight the areas where, in my belief, the report is excessively comprehensive.",1
"Madam President, I would like to reply briefly to the two points raised by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.","Madam President, I will give a quick response to the two issues brought up by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy.",1
The first was on the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam.,The initial discussion focused on how the Treaty of Amsterdam was being put into practice.,1
What we are doing here is preparing Parliament for that time.,We are in the process of readying Parliament for what lies ahead.,1
The second point was whether we have gone too far with these changes to the Rules.,The second issue is to consider if these modifications to the Rules are excessive.,1
I believe a parliament's most fundamental right is to adapt its rules to the constant changes in parliamentary life.,A parliament must have the intrinsic right to modify its rules in response to the ever-changing nature of its activities.,1
For this reason I cannot accept Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's second point either.,"Therefore, I must reject the second point made by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy as well.",1
Does anyone wish to speak against?,Does somebody want to speak in opposition?,1
"To return to the first question, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is well acquainted with the nature of statutory law.","Returning to the initial query, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy knows what statutory law entails.",1
Does anyone wish to speak in favour of the motion by Mr Fabre-Aubrespy?,Is there anyone willing to speak up for Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's motion?,1
That is not the case.,That isn't true.,1
Parliament rejected the motion,The motion was not accepted by Parliament.,1
It does not simply deal with the necessary transposition into Parliament's Rules of what is contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam.,It involves more than just including what the Treaty of Amsterdam stipulates into the Parliament's regulations.,1
"In short, we are preparing Parliament for a new era.","To put it simply, we are readying Parliament for a different epoch.",1
Parliament has traditionally taken the treaties and tried to stretch them like a piece of elastic.,"Traditionally, Parliament has attempted to extend the interpretation of the treaties as far as possible.",1
"We cannot contradict the treaties, we cannot do things that are forbidden by the treaties.",We must not go against the treaties or engage in prohibited actions under them.,1
"But the treaties inevitably allow a margin of appreciation, a scope for interpretation.","The treaties, however, permit some leeway and interpretative flexibility.",1
They leave space and gaps to fill in.,They create openings and spaces that need filling.,1
"Parliament has always tried to do that in order to make the Union more effective, more open, more transparent and more democratic.","To increase effectiveness, openness, transparency, and democracy, the Parliament has unfailingly striven for these goals within the Union.",1
That is the philosophy that underlies this revision of the Rules of Procedure.,The underlying philosophy guided the updates to the Rules of Procedure.,1
"Much work has therefore gone, in this report, into improving and redefining our legislative procedures.","Consequently, this report has seen considerable effort dedicated to enhancing and refining our legislative processes.",1
This includes technical improvements to simplify the way that we vote in plenary.,Technical enhancements are being made to streamline our voting in plenary sessions.,1
In another area we have looked at the new provisions giving Parliament the right to vote on the President of the Commission.,We have considered the recent changes that permit Parliament to participate in electing the President of the Commission.,1
The Commission is not an unaccountable bureaucracy as some eurosceptics would have us believe.,"The Commission is accountable, despite the beliefs propagated by some eurosceptics.",1
The Commission is a political executive accountable to the directly elected Parliament.,The Commission acts as a political authority and is responsible to the Parliament elected by the people.,1
"This, too, we have attempted to highlight in the revision of the Rules of Procedure.","In the procedural rules' update, we aimed to make this clear.",1
The Rule changes do this.,This is what the alterations to the Rule accomplish.,1
"We have taken up a number of suggestions made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy in this regard.","We have accepted various proposals from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy on this matter.",1
They include provisions for dealing with the new High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.,They establish arrangements for the new High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.,1
We hope we have come up with a balanced package there.,We are hopeful that our package is balanced.,1
We have tried to rationalise our procedures in other ways.,We've made attempts to streamline our methods differently.,1
"For legislative reports, for instance, there would no longer be explanatory statements.",Legislative reports would not include explanatory statements anymore.,1
"Similarly, opinions from other committees would be confined to tabling specific amendments.",Other committees would be restricted to presenting specific amendments for consideration.,1
"Here we are following up the recent report on openness and transparency by my colleague, Mrs Lööw.","We are continuing the efforts regarding transparency and openness highlighted in the recent report by my colleague, Mrs. Lööw.""",1
"We also provide for the Rules of Procedure to be rewritten, where necessary, in gender-neutral language.","The Rules of Procedure are to be rephrased in a gender-neutral manner, should it be deemed necessary.",1
There are also minor things taken up in these rule changes.,Minor aspects are addressed in these amendments to the rules.,1
I shall not go into all of them.,I will not cover each of them.,1
A lot of minor details are tidied up and we seek to improve procedures wherever possible.,"Many minor aspects are being refined, and we aim for better processes in every way we can.",1
They will also make Parliament more open and transparent.,Parliament's transparency and openness will be enhanced as well.,1
I have no hesitation in commending this package to the House.,I confidently recommend this package to the assembly.,1
"As the explanatory statement points out, we are dealing here with a proposal to amend our Rules of Procedure.",The explanatory statement indicates that this is a proposal to modify our procedural rules.,1
This revision was prompted by the changes required to prepare for the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam.,The need for alterations due to the Treaty of Amsterdam instigated this revision.,1
The results achieved are proof of this. The representatives of the various political groups have also helped to achieve this consensus.,"This is evidenced by the results, with political group representatives contributing to the consensus.",1
As part of my modest contribution I should like to highlight certain points which I believe to be particularly important.,"In making a small contribution, I want to underscore a few key points.",1
It is to be hoped that tomorrow's vote will represent a satisfactory outcome for the work that has been carried out.,The expectation is that tomorrow's vote will yield a favorable result for the completed work.,1
"Thank you, Mr Gutiérrez Díaz.",I extend my thanks to Mr. Gutiérrez Díaz.,1
"The vote will not take place tomorrow morning, but on Thursday morning, as I will have the chance to make clear shortly.","As I will clarify in a moment, the vote is postponed till Thursday morning instead of tomorrow.",1
"In this context, I should like to add my voice to those who have congratulated the other two rapporteurs.","In this context, I too would like to extend congratulations to the other two rapporteurs.",1
They worked as a team on a task where natural differences of opinion actually make the work even more challenging.,"Working collaboratively on a task, they encountered increased difficulty due to the natural variance in their opinions.",1
"Madam President, I referred to our Rules as a way of regulating our communal life, and the lodestar of parliamentary activity.","Madam President, I mentioned our Rules as a means to organize our collective existence and as the guiding principle for our parliamentary endeavors.",1
"Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that the Rules of Procedure have a much more important role to play.","Still, let's not overlook that the Rules of Procedure play a substantially bigger role.",1
"They are a symbol, a banner, a programme and a point of reference.","They function as a symbol, a rallying point, a strategic plan, and a reference mark.",1
"The Rules must be practical and realistic, whilst retaining their emblematic value.","While the Rules need to be grounded in practicality, they mustn't lose their iconic significance.",1
"All the amendments are important, Madam President.","Every change is significant, Madam President.",1
"Nevertheless, the amendments can be grouped into three main categories, according to their nature.","However, the changes fall into three primary groups based on their type.",1
Amendment No 16 on the election of the President of the European Commission has also received a great deal of criticism.,"Criticism has also been leveled at Amendment No 16, which pertains to the selection of the President of the European Commission.",1
"I shall not go into details on the High Representative, as his or her function has already been extensively debated.",I won't elaborate on the High Representative's role since it has been widely discussed.,1
It clearly reflects the new guidelines laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam.,It definitely mirrors the new directions set out in the Amsterdam Treaty.,1
"Madam President, I referred earlier to inherited inertia, and this leads me to the third group of amendments, to which Mr Fabre-Aubrespy referred.","Madam President, relating back to the topic of inherited inertia, I am now addressing the third collection of amendments that were highlighted by Mr. Fabre-Aubrespy.",1
The will is certainly there.,The desire is definitely present.,1
"Finally, now that I am discussing resources, new technologies and speaking time, my own speaking time has elapsed.","To conclude, as I address the topics of resources, new technologies, and the allotment of time for speaking, I realize that my allotted time to speak has run out.",1
Some people in this Parliament describe the Rules Committee as like watching paint dry in 11 languages.,"Some individuals in Parliament equate the Rules Committee's proceedings to watching paint dry, but in 11 different languages.",1
Mr Corbett and his colleagues have very adequately outlined the thrust of their report.,Mr. Corbett and his colleagues have clearly explained the central focus of their report.,1
We now know that every Member has five shadows behind him.,It has become apparent that each Member is accompanied by five shadows.,1
But dialogue should not turn into ownership.,Dialogue ought not to result in possession.,1
In these reports a number of holes in the system are being filled in.,These reports are plugging several holes in the system.,1
"Firstly, Amendment No 10 from my own report deals with the plight of former Members.",The tenth amendment of my report addresses the situation of ex-Members.,1
"Fourthly, Amendment No 111 deals with two problems.",Amendment No 111 addresses a couple of issues.,1
The second part makes it clear that benefits of a value greater than ECU 100 must be declared.,The latter section indicates that any benefits exceeding ECU 100 need to be reported.,1
It is a guarantee for the Member of Parliament and there is no question of changing it.,The assurance given to the Member of Parliament is irrevocable.,1
"I would now like to speak on the report as a whole to explain why, on behalf of my group, I am opposed to its adoption.",I wish to discuss the entirety of the report to clarify the reasons my group and I are against its approval.,1
But the text also goes beyond the Treaty of Amsterdam.,"However, the content of the text surpasses the Amsterdam Treaty's provisions.",1
This also applies to Amendments Nos 67 and 68 on the common foreign and security policy.,Amendments Nos 67 and 68 pertain to the common foreign and security policy too.,1
It also applies to Amendment No 14 on censure of parliamentary office-holders and to Amendment No 78.,"Amendment No 14 on censure of officials in parliament, as well as Amendment No 78, are also applicable.",1
I refer Members interested in these issues to the minority opinion where I have set out my reservations.,Members who are concerned with these matters can find my reservations outlined in the minority opinion.,1
"Secondly, we wish to enhance Parliament's powers to monitor withdrawals of candidates under national law.","Furthermore, we aim to strengthen Parliament's ability to oversee the withdrawal of candidates according to national legislation.",1
"Madam President, first I have to present my own modest part in this overall report.","Madam President, initially, I must introduce the contribution that I have made to this comprehensive report.",1
It was also necessary to decide where the minority opinion should appear.,A decision was also needed regarding the location for the minority viewpoint.,1
The opinion must be expressed when the vote on the full text is taken in committee.,"When the committee casts its vote on the complete text, the opinion should be stated.",1
"That is the intent of Amendment No 99, which clarifies paragraph 3 of Rule 146.",Amendment No 99 aims to make paragraph 3 of Rule 146 clearer.,1
But that is not really my problem.,"Yet, it isn't actually my concern.",1
What I criticise is the spirit underlying these amendments.,My criticism is aimed at the mentality behind these changes.,1
The acid test of the democratic culture of a parliament is minority rights.,The true measure of a parliament's democratic nature lies in how it treats minority rights.,1
Have they been strengthened or weakened here?,Were they made stronger or weaker in this context?,1
"That is what makes it so precarious, for it would mean that minority rights were restricted rather than strengthened.",This situation is particularly risky as it could result in the limitation of minority rights instead of their reinforcement.,1
There are many examples of this.,Numerous instances of this exist.,1
That is the reverse of making Parliament more democratic.,Such an action contradicts the goal of increasing Parliament's democratic processes.,1
The code of conduct is adopted by an absolute majority.,"The conduct code is enacted by attaining an absolute majority vote."" This retains the original meaning that the code of conduct has been adopted, and it specifies the way it has been done—through an absolute majority, avoiding any significant changes or additions to the original context",1
"Let me make one final point, Madam President.","Allow me to make one last remark, Madam President.",1
This is like clearing out the Rules Committee's cupboards.,It's akin to emptying the cupboards of the Rules Committee.,1
"I do not think it is a very useful practice, but I suppose it is better than nothing at all.","While I don't find it particularly useful, it's somewhat better than having no solution.",1
"Thank you, Mr Fayot.","I appreciate it, Mr. Fayot.",1
"I note that by addressing the Chair as 'Madame la Présidente ', you are already applying the proposals made by Mr Corbett.","I observe that by referring to the Chair as 'Madame la Présidente', you are already putting Mr. Corbett's suggestions into practice.",1
"Madam President, in French I would say 'Madame le Président ', because the position you hold represents a role.","Madam President, if I were to use French, I would say 'Madame le Président', emphasizing the title of your position.",1
"So we should see you not as an individual person, but in a particular role.","We ought to view you not just personally, but in a specific capacity.",1
Mr Ford has already covered it for me extremely well.,Mr. Ford has detailed it for me exceptionally well.,1
I cannot in all honesty say that it was unduly prominent.,"Honestly, I cannot declare it was excessively conspicuous.",1
One last comment addressed to Mr Voggenhuber.,I need to make a final remark for Mr. Voggenhuber.,1
"He is exaggerating, these are not Rules of Procedure for the big groups.",He is overstating; these aren't procedural rules for the major factions.,1
All they do is consolidate the current position.,They simply reinforce the existing situation.,1
Forgive me for exceeding my speaking time.,I apologize for talking beyond my allotted time.,1
It was due to inattentiveness on the Council's part.,The reason was the Council's lack of attentiveness.,1
Such groupings in the European Parliament often perform a valuable role.,These associations within the European Parliament frequently play an important part.,1
These rule changes should make everything much more open.,These amendments to the rules are intended to open things up substantially.,1
"Finally, the quaestors are charged with drawing up detailed rules.","Ultimately, the quaestors have the responsibility to draft specific regulations.",1
That would enable everyone to see who might be influencing whom.,That would allow all to observe the potential influencers and their targets.,1
"Madam President, my task on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is an easy one.","Madam President, representing the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is a straightforward task.",1
Our suggestions have been both accepted and now explained by the rapporteurs.,The rapporteurs have accepted and elucidated our recommendations.,1
"So, I can endorse these rule changes heartily.","Therefore, I can fully support these amendments to the rules.",1
I have had the opportunity of watching the Conference of Presidents in action.,I've had the chance to observe the Conference of Presidents at work.,1
It is consistently overworked and often ill-briefed.,It's always pushed to its limits and sometimes inadequately informed.,1
They cannot be experts on everything.,They can't have expertise in every domain.,1
They each lead complex coalitions.,They are at the forefront of intricate coalitions.,1
"Madam President, first let me express my appreciation to the rapporteurs and congratulate them on their comprehensive work.","Madam President, allow me to first extend my gratitude and congratulations to the rapporteurs for their thorough work."" This version maintains the formal address to the President, the sequence of gratitude followed by congratulations, and signifies that the work of the rapporteurs was comprehensive without diverging from the source material",1
The revision of the Rules of Procedure focuses on the innovations arising from the Amsterdam Treaty.,Changes to the Rules of Procedure stem from the Amsterdam Treaty's innovations.,1
It tabled only two amendments.,Just a pair of amendments were submitted.,1
"Unfortunately, neither amendment has been adopted to date.","Unfortunately, up to now, both amendments remain unadopted.",1
"Meanwhile things have progressed, however.","Things have moved forward, nonetheless.",1
These inconsistencies must be remedied immediately to ensure the smooth running and completion of the discharge procedure.,Immediate action is required to rectify these inconsistencies and make sure the discharge process is completed efficiently.,1
"Corresponding provisions, modelled on Rule 44 or Rule 52, could be inserted in the Rules of Procedure.",Provisions similar to Rule 44 or Rule 52 might be added to the procedural rules.,1
I thank the rapporteurs and hope our amendments will be adopted.,I show gratitude to the rapporteurs and look forward to our changes being accepted.,1
That is a grave mistake.,That's a serious error.,1
"Behind rules there are thoughts, ideas, concepts, aims, strategies.","Rules originate from underlying thoughts, ideas, concepts, aspirations, and strategies.",1
The thought behind that is obvious.,The reasoning for that is clear.,1
Roll-call votes split Parliament into national delegations and political groups.,Roll-call votes divide the members of Parliament by their countries and political affiliations.,1
Now we are introducing it for approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole.,It's now time for the President of the Commission and all Commission members to give their consent.,1
And that means that we too are exposing ourselves to pressure and can therefore be controlled.,"This signifies that we are also subjecting ourselves to pressure and, consequently, can be influenced.",1
That is the result!,That's the outcome!,1
Parliament would be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot.,"If Parliament's votes were conducted in secrecy, it would become stronger.",1
In fact the Commission would also be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot.,The Commission's strength would be enhanced by a secret ballot.,1
This vote on approval would not give the impression of being a forced vote.,This approval vote would not seem coerced.,1
That is why I regard this as a grave mistake.,That's why I consider this to be a serious error.,1
I cannot imagine that Members really want it.,I can't conceive that Members genuinely desire this.,1
Hence my appeal to support the amendments calling for a vote by secret ballot.,"Therefore, I urge you to back the proposals that require a confidential vote.",1
"Madam President, the Group of the European People's Party supports the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.","The European People's Party Group backs the changes suggested by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, Madam President.",1
I should like to respond to the remarks made by Mr Rothley on behalf of the Socialist Group.,I wish to address what Mr. Rothley has expressed on behalf of the Socialist Group.,1
"As ever, his remarks were pertinent and largely justified.",His comments were as relevant as usual and mostly warranted.,1
"Notwithstanding this, we shall certainly consider the suggestions put forward by the Socialist Group.","Despite this, we will definitely take into account the proposals from the Socialist Group.",1
"In our view, it achieves nothing and would result in more complications than advantages.",We believe it is ineffective and would create more problems than benefits.,1
A large majority opposes the exclusion amendments to Rule 90 and the one-minute speeches in Rule 78.,The amendments to Rule 90 which lead to exclusions and the brief speeches mandated by Rule 78 are met with significant resistance from the majority.,1
"Before Thursday, therefore, an oral amendment or technical amendment needs to be introduced to take account of this situation.","Hence, an oral or technical amendment must be proposed before Thursday to address this situation.",1
That is a very dangerous development in the wrong direction.,That marks a hazardous trend going in the wrong direction.,1
I would commend this amendment to the House.,I recommend that the House consider this amendment favorably.,1
It is totally unacceptable to attempt to overstep the clear boundaries set in the Treaty.,Overstepping the Treaty's explicit limits is wholly intolerable.,1
The report also contains other proposals that are equally unacceptable.,The document has further suggestions that cannot be accepted either.,1
I think there are many people in the House who regard censorship of this type as undesirable.,Many individuals in the House consider this form of censorship to be unwelcome.,1
We all know that different viewpoints can be accommodated within the various political groups.,It is common knowledge that a range of opinions can be held within the different political factions.,1
I therefore hope this proposal will not succeed for one reason or another.,"I hope that this proposal will be unsuccessful, regardless of the reason.",1
"Likewise, the role of the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy and the special officers should also be brought before this Parliament.","Similarly, this Parliament should examine the function of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and the special representatives.",1
We are imposing new restrictions which we do not have the power to do under the Treaty.,The Treaty doesn't give us the authority to enforce these new restrictions.,1
"Many of the amendments were eliminated in committee, but a few that worry me remain.","Although the committee removed numerous amendments, there are still some that concern me.",1
"Madam President, at present the Commissioners are appointed by each individual Member State.","Currently, Madam President, the appointment of Commissioners is by the individual Member States.",1
So ultimately our voters are the ones who have the final say and indirectly appoint the Danish Member of the Commission.,Our voters ultimately exert an indirect influence on the selection of the Danish Member of the Commission.,1
But now Parliament is saying instead that it should elect or reject the Commission.,Parliament now suggests it be given the power to elect or dismiss the Commission.,1
The Commission is to be elected by Parliament in almost the same way as a national parliament elects a government.,Parliament will elect the Commission similarly to how a government is elected by a national parliament.,1
That is a recipe for a federal state with a common parliament and a common government.,"Such a method leads to the creation of a federal state, including a shared parliament and government.",1
That is contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore illegal.,"Such action goes against the Amsterdam Treaty, making it unlawful.",1
Parliament cannot simply take power from the Member States on its own authority.,Member States' power cannot be unilaterally claimed by the Parliament.,1
"I agree with 99 % of what they have produced; however, there are two points on which our views diverge.","I concur with almost everything they've put forward, but there are a couple of aspects where we differ.",1
The first concerns the proposal that would prevent political groups being formed of Members from one country only.,The proposal aims to prohibit the establishment of political groups made up exclusively of Members from the same country.,1
The Rules of Procedure should be politically neutral.,The procedural rules ought to be impartial to politics.,1
"For that reason, I am going to vote against this amendment.","Therefore, I will cast my vote in opposition to this amendment.",1
It is already difficult enough to table amendments in this House.,Submitting amendments in this House is already quite challenging.,1
Such a change would only add to the difficulties.,Any such alteration would simply complicate matters further.,1
"Furthermore, the gains in efficiency that would result from such a change are negligible.","Additionally, the improvements in efficiency from making this change are minimal.",1
"At most, only a tiny fraction of all the votes are mutually exclusive.",A minimal number of votes are actually in conflict with one another.,1
"Consequently, I am going to vote against these two proposals.","Therefore, I will cast my vote in opposition to the two suggestions.",1
But this role must be performed throughout the legislative process.,This function needs to be fulfilled from start to finish of the law-making procedure.,1
"Mr President, the European Parliament is a young parliament.","Mr. President, the European Parliament is relatively new.",1
"Twenty years is barely an anniversary, not quite the age of reason.","Twenty years is hardly a notable milestone, not quite the age of mature judgment.",1
"So our Rules, which are the charter of our parliamentary life, are particularly important.","Therefore, our Rules, serving as the foundation for our parliamentary existence, hold significant importance.",1
"For democracy to work despite all our differences, the letter as well as the spirit of the Rules must be observed.","Democracy's efficacy hinges on our adherence to both the Rules' specific provisions and their overarching principles, despite varied opinions.",1
That is also why the Rules need to evolve.,"Therefore, the Rules must develop over time.",1
So I cannot accept Mr Voggenhuber's complaint that this change in the Rules means less democracy.,"Therefore, Mr. Voggenhuber's argument that altering the Rules leads to diminished democracy is not something I can agree with.",1
I think a balance has been struck between democracy and effectiveness.,I believe there's a balance between democratic processes and efficiency.,1
I think it is important to oil the wheels of our procedures.,I consider greasing the gears of our procedures to be significant.,1
I shall single out certain features of the new Rules which merit special consideration.,I will highlight specific aspects of the new Regulations that deserve particular attention.,1

"Consequently, we feel that the amendment tabled by Mrs Palacio which provides for the Commission's presence is entirely appropriate.",We agree that Mrs. Palacio's amendment ensuring the Commission’s participation is quite fitting.,1
We therefore feel that it would be premature to formalise arrangements concerning comitology in the Rules.,"We thus consider it premature to set formal comitology provisions in the Rules."" This final paraphrase maintains the original meaning with a synonym for ""feel"" (consider) and ""arrangements"" (provisions), and retains ""premature"" and the phrase ""in the Rules,"" preserving the source's intent and content",1
I should also like to inform the rapporteurs that we are happier with the final version of Rule 107(9) on speaking time.,"I should mention to the rapporteurs that the latest form of Rule 107(9), which pertains to time allocations for speaking, is more satisfactory to us.",1

We should be guided by the experiences of the USA and Japan.,Let the USA and Japan's experiences inform our approach.,1
We should also learn from experience.,We should take lessons from our past actions.,1
I believe it is most important that we also include tropical diseases in Amendments Nos 1 and 2.,I believe it is most important that we also include tropical diseases in Amendments Nos 1 and 2.,1
"That is not necessarily the case under this regulation, but we must create an instrument to do so very quickly.","While this regulation doesn't guarantee this, we should swiftly establish a tool that does.",1
"This applies, for instance, to Amendment No 18, on which I would be interested to hear the Commission's view.","For example, I would like to know the Commission's opinion on Amendment Number 18.",1
Personally I doubt it.,I have my reservations.,1
"Finally, I want to raise the question of diagnosis, which we have already had occasion to consider in committee.","Lastly, I'd like to discuss the matter of diagnosis that we've examined in committee before.",1
It took the Commission long enough to present a proposal for a European orphan drug act.,The Commission took its time before introducing a proposal for a European orphan drug act.,1
I would certainly be interested to know whether the Commission sees any possibility of doing so.,I'm definitely eager to find out if the Commission considers such an action feasible.,1
It would also be a good idea to set up a special fund for additional support for the development of these medicines.,A specialized fund for the purpose of giving more support to these medications' development would be advantageous.,1
"The rapporteur has done much towards achieving this, thanks to his very careful work.",The reporter has contributed significantly to this through his meticulous efforts.,1
And that is perfectly understandable.,That is completely reasonable.,1
"For the rest, we have been trying for many years to control and counter this situation.","For a long time, we've been making efforts to regulate and resist this situation.",1
It is not the case that nothing has been done in past years.,Efforts have been made in previous years.,1
But it is clear that with the experience we have gained from America we can perhaps present an improved proposal now.,"Given our experience with America, we may now be in a position to suggest a more advanced proposal.",1
The problem is easy to describe.,Describing the issue is straightforward.,1
"Since there are no economic incentives, we have to compensate for this.",We must make up for the lack of financial motivations.,1
"Of course we can do so directly through support for research, and we shall continue to do so in future.","Naturally, we can provide assistance directly through research funding, and this will persist into the future.",1
Even more emphasis has been put on this kind of research in the fifth framework programme.,The fifth framework programme has given even greater priority to this research.,1
"In that respect the situation there has not changed, and if it has, only for the good.","Regarding that matter, there has been no change in the situation, and any changes have been positive.",1
"But we also want to create a range of additional incentives, for instance through the ten-year market exclusivity right.","Additionally, we aim to introduce further incentives, such as a decade-long exclusive market right.",1
"On the contrary, the opportunities to do so will be fairly restricted.","Rather, the chances to do so will be quite limited.",1
"We cannot propose any tax relief, at least not at this stage, because it is not up to us to decide this.","Offering tax relief is not something we can do at this moment, as the decision isn't ours.",1
The Member States would have to do so.,It would be necessary for the Member States to proceed in that manner.,1
At this point we want to wait and see what the effects are of these experiences.,"Currently, we prefer to observe the outcomes stemming from these events.",1
Tax relief is always a very convenient way of creating incentives.,Offering tax relief is always an effective method for promoting incentives.,1

Of course you can always try to formulate others.,"Certainly, it's always possible to devise more.",1
But then you must remember the aim of our proposal.,You need to keep in mind the purpose behind our proposed plan.,1
We want to support research.,We aim to back scientific investigations.,1
There are problems with economic criteria.,Economic criteria pose certain challenges.,1
Forecasts and projections can hardly be made before the expiry of the ten-year period.,We can't really make any predictions or forecasts until the ten years have passed.,1
"As I said, we are at first reading.","As I mentioned, this is the initial reading.",1
Let me begin by telling you which amendments we can accept.,I'll start by outlining the acceptable amendments.,1
"There is a whole series of them: Nos 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 29, 32, 38 and 9 in part.","A lengthy list follows, inclusive of numbers 4, 5, 8, and 10 to 14, then 16, 17, 19 to 21, 29, 32, 38, and a segment of 9.",1
"The USA had a similar criterion, which did not prove successful.",The United States had a comparable standard that was unsuccessful.,1
It did not work.,It wasn't successful.,1
That is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult.,"Hence, our goal is to aid research, not to hinder it.",1
That is why we do not want to accept that amendment.,"Therefore, we are not inclined to agree to that amendment.",1
"I will now look at the second group, concerning diagnosis, namely Amendments Nos 33, 34, 35, 41 and 42.","I will proceed to evaluate the second collection of amendments, which pertain to diagnosis, namely Amendments 33, 34, 35, 41, and 42.",1

Of course we support the view that specific measures to support research in developing countries are useful.,We certainly agree that targeted measures to aid research in developing countries have their benefits.,1
But we do not take the view that including a corresponding reference to this in a recital can produce that result.,"However, we don't believe adding a similar mention in the preamble will have that effect.",1
But that is not a very logical way to make legislation.,"However, it is not a logical method to create laws.",1
That is why we hope we can come back to this question of tropical diseases.,We hope to revisit the issue of tropical diseases.,1
It is not the case that we have not lived up to our obligations here to date.,We have been fulfilling our obligations up until now.,1
I did not go into this matter directly.,I didn't tackle this topic in a straightforward manner.,1
"As I already said, this is the first reading.","As previously mentioned, we are at the initial reading.",1
That is why I did not want to go into all the amendments.,That's the reason I chose not to discuss every amendment in detail.,1
That is more or less the same argument I put forward in regard to tax relief and against the fund in general.,That argument is essentially what I presented concerning tax relief and in opposition to the fund overall.,1
I have already spoken against the fund.,I have previously expressed opposition to the fund.,1
"After all, that is what always happens.",That's the usual outcome.,1
"But if this period were further extended, that would have adverse effects.","However, increasing this duration could lead to negative outcomes.",1

"Mr President, this is a recommendation and not a directive.","Mr. President, we are dealing with a recommendation, not a directive.",1

It will be resumed at 3 p.m.,The continuation is scheduled for 3 p.m.,1

First there is the paragraph inviting the Commission to withdraw its proposal.,The initial paragraph calls on the Commission to pull back its proposal.,1
I do not know whether that formula is to do with the internal organisation of the Commission.,I'm unsure if that formula pertains to the Commission's internal structure.,1
"If he does so, can we be sure the college will back him?",Can we be certain of the college's support if he takes that step?,1

It reads 'uppmanar medlemsstaterna att ... under vissa omständigheter ... ',It's worded as 'instructs the member states to ... under certain conditions ... ',1
We have requested that these last three words 'under certain conditions' should be deleted.,Our request was for the removal of the words 'under certain conditions.',1
It is therefore very odd that the original text has been retained in this amendment.,"Thus, it's surprising that the amendment still includes the original wording.",1
I would like to draw this to the attention of all Swedish Members.,I want to notify all the members from Sweden.,1
We shall see.,Time will tell.,1
"If the amendment is adopted, then of course we will make the correction.","Upon the amendment's adoption, it's clear that we will implement the necessary correction.",1
We shall take care to do that.,We will attend to that matter.,1
The authentic text is 'under certain conditions'.,The true document cites 'subject to certain conditions'.,1
That needs to be made very clear.,It's necessary to clarify that thoroughly.,1
So it has to be 'under certain conditions'.,"Consequently, certain conditions must apply.",1
"We shall of course carry out a check, when the vote has taken place, so that everything is brought into line with the original text.","Once the voting is complete, we will, naturally, verify the alignment with the first document.",1

We therefore think that the very restrictive advice which would result from supporting the amendments is untenable.,"Consequently, we believe that the excessively limiting guidance arising from backing the amendments cannot be justified.",1
We cannot get round the fact that electricity is a fundamental cornerstone of modern society.,It's an inescapable reality that electricity forms the base of contemporary life.,1
One cannot of course rule out the possibility that the long-term effects might be different.,It's impossible to completely dismiss the chance that effects may vary over an extended period.,1
"Mr President, electromagnetic fields are increasingly present in our environment.","Mr President, our environment is continually seeing an increase in electromagnetic fields.",1
"High-voltage power lines, GSM radio transmitters and many domestic appliances are disrupting the natural balance.","The natural equilibrium is being affected by GSM transmitters, high-voltage power lines, and domestic devices.",1
A Commissioner said that the best way to validate a product is to place it on the market.,"Putting a product out for sale is the most effective validation method, as a Commissioner suggested.",1
And yet the precise effects on the organism of exposure to electromagnetic radiation are not known.,The specific impacts on living organisms from electromagnetic radiation exposure remain unclear.,1
Experiments have proved only that prolonged exposure to high frequencies may cause pathologies.,Studies have only shown a potential risk of pathology from long-term exposure to high sound frequencies.,1
"The recommendation introduces, throughout Europe, a proper level of protection against EMF health effects.",The recommendation aims to set a consistent level of health protection from EMF throughout Europe.,1
This will be one of the sections of the Fifth Research and Development Framework Programme.,This section will be included in the Fifth Research and Development Framework Programme.,1
There are limited resources for public health and we must see to it that they are exploited effectively.,We must ensure that the scarce public health resources are utilized efficiently.,1
We have to consider what social costs are worth paying so that public health can expect a good return on its investment.,We must weigh the social costs against the anticipated gains in public health from our investments.,1
Politicians have a responsibility in all this.,Politicians carry a responsibility in these matters.,1
The Commission's estimates of what would be health-endangering values reflect the outcome of the research carried out.,Research results are reflected in the Commission's determinations of potentially harmful health levels.,1
"We must respect the precautionary principle, but excessive caution must be substantiated by the results of research.","It's important to adhere to the precautionary principle, yet any excess in caution should be justified through research findings.",1
There is a total contradiction there.,There's an absolute conflict in that situation.,1
We do not have that evidence.,That proof is not in our possession.,1
One of the major failings in the Commission's proposal is that it does not take the precautionary approach.,A significant shortcoming of the Commission's proposal is its failure to adopt a precautionary stance.,1
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been a complete disaster on this.","This has been an area of total failure for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.",1
It has completely diluted the rapporteur's proposal.,The proposal by the rapporteur has been entirely watered down.,1
It has failed to protect public health and the environment.,It has not been successful in guarding environmental and public health.,1
In my own country mobile phone masts are erected close to people's houses and right beside schools.,Mobile phone towers are being built near where people live and next to schools in my country.,1
"There are reports of headaches, sleep disruption and a number of other effects, which are not referred to by the Commission.",Headaches and sleep disruption are among several reported effects not acknowledged by the Commission.,1
We need to ensure that the precautionary approach is taken.,It's necessary to guarantee the use of a precautionary strategy.,1
The Commission seems to base its findings on certain research but to ignore other research that is available.,The Commission appears to rely on some studies while disregarding other available ones.,1
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that this is an important matter.","Mr. President, I'd like to start by acknowledging the significance of this issue.",1
We obviously have to regulate the amount of radiation that people are exposed to.,We have to control how much radiation individuals are subjected to.,1
"However, it is essential that the rules should be reasonable.","Nonetheless, the importance of having sensible rules cannot be overstated.",1
"In point of fact, we still do not have any precise answers to the questions which they raise.",We have yet to find precise answers to these questions.,1
We do not know how ordinary electric currents and magnetic fields affect us.,The influence of regular electric currents and magnetic fields on us is not clear.,1
"What we do know, however, is that more and more people are becoming hypersensitive to electricity.","However, it is known that the number of electricity hypersensitive individuals is on the rise.",1
"We should be establishing limit values on a Europe-wide basis, but they should be reasonable as well.","It's essential to set Europe-wide limit values, ensuring they are fair too.",1
Sweden has been mentioned in the discussion as one of the countries with satisfactory limit values.,Sweden was brought up in the dialogue as a country having acceptable limit values.,1
The values are 100 micro tesla in normal daily life and 500 micro tesla in industry and places of work.,"Ordinary daily environments exhibit values of 100 micro tesla, and industrial sites and workplaces display values of 500 micro tesla.",1
That is substantially different from those proposed by Mr Tamino.,That significantly deviates from Mr. Tamino's suggestions.,1
First of all there is low-frequency radiation from high-tension cables and frequencies generated by them.,"Initially, we are considering radiation at low frequencies that originate from high-voltage power lines and the frequencies they produce.",1
"In Denmark, we have a cancer register in which all cancer cases are recorded, and the central register of persons shows where people live.",Denmark maintains a record of all cancer diagnoses and also has a central register that details where people reside.,1
Then there are mobile telephones.,There are also mobile phones to consider.,1
"These are concentrated rays, but they do not penetrate down to where we usually are.","Although these rays are focused, they don't reach our typical level of habitation.",1
"Mr President, it is really important that we produce a recommendation for minimum distances from people's homes for mobile phone masts.","Mr. President, establishing guidelines for how far mobile phone masts should be from homes is crucial.",1
These are proliferating in my own country.,"In my country, these are multiplying rapidly.",1
That is something that we should be considering seriously at European level.,We need to seriously think about that across Europe.,1
"If they are not dangerous, then there is no risk.","Should they not be harmful, then risk is not present.",1
So why should we not insure people against the problem?,Why wouldn't insuring individuals against the issue be a good idea?,1
There is sufficient evidence to warrant a whole re-think on the health implications of these masts.,There is enough evidence to justify completely reconsidering the health impacts of these towers.,1
So the Commission proposals are very timely.,"Thus, the propositions from the Commission come at an opportune moment.",1
We need some form of European-wide action on this issue.,Some kind of action across Europe is required for this issue.,1
"The approach of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is also very balanced.","The method undertaken by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is equally measured.",1
I want to stress two amendments which are important.,I aim to emphasize a couple of significant amendments.,1
"The first deals with the application of the precautionary principle, based on the ALARA proposals from the World Health Organization.","The initial point addresses the use of the precautionary principle, in line with the ALARA proposals that the World Health Organization has put forward.",1
My second point is that we must keep this under constant review.,We have to continually reassess this matter.,1
It is not enough to set standards now and then never come back to them.,Setting standards occasionally without subsequent review is insufficient.,1
So I hope the Commission will take into account some of these amendments.,So I trust the Commission will consider including some of these amendments.,1
But well-intentioned does not always mean good.,"However, having good intentions doesn't always result in positive outcomes.",1
Or should we go so far as to get rid of mobile phones and emergency telephones?,Or should we consider the extreme measure of eliminating mobile and emergency phones?,1
I do not think that can do us much good.,I believe that won't be very beneficial for us.,1
Let me raise another point.,I'd like to bring up a different matter.,1
"In the case of electrical devices, laying down minimum safety distances is even more of a problem.",Establishing minimum safety distances is particularly challenging for electrical devices.,1
As a rule the distance between such devices and the public is surely determined by whether they are used as they should be.,The extent to which such devices are kept from the public typically hinges on their proper usage.,1
"The situation is different in the case of equipment that is designed to produce fields, such as broadcasting transmitters.","For devices intended to emit fields, like broadcasting transmitters, the scenario varies.",1
"Here, safety distances can no doubt simplify matters.","In this context, maintaining safety distances could undoubtedly make things simpler.",1
I have tabled the corresponding amendments.,I've submitted the relevant amendments.,1
"For one thing, there is increasing concern - and that is undoubtedly true - on the part of experts too.",There is an undeniable rise in concern among experts as well.,1
So it is not the case that we have not taken account of these scientific positions.,It's incorrect to say that we've ignored these scientific positions.,1
"I could now discuss all the amendments, but that would be going too far, given also that this is a recommendation.","Discussing every amendment would be excessive, especially since this is just a recommendation.",1
"But let me say that we can accept in whole or in part Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 13.","However, I can confirm that Amendments 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 13 are entirely or partially acceptable to us.",1
That applies in particular to the question of minimum safety distances.,This is particularly relevant for setting minimum distances for safety.,1
Mr Schnellhardt made a few comments on this question that are worth considering.,Mr. Schnellhardt provided some insights on this matter that merit attention.,1
We have already made provision for a review system.,A system for review has already been established by us.,1
"If necessary, the Commission will act at once.","Should it be required, the Commission will take immediate action.",1
We cannot proceed according to that kind of principle.,Following that principle is not an option for us.,1
I am saying this with particular reference to some of the comments made by the Greens.,This is in direct response to remarks from the Greens.,1
"If, for instance, we switched off the entire electricity network, I wonder what the public would say to that.","I wonder how the public would react if we were to shut down the entire electrical grid, for example.",1
I did say 'if'.,I included the condition 'if'.,1
"So if we want to proceed in a sensible manner here, we can only do so in the light of and on the basis of scientific findings.","To act sensibly in this matter, we have to rely on scientific findings.",1
Any other approach would be arbitrary and not right.,Any alternative method would be unjustifiably arbitrary and incorrect.,1
And the Commission does apply that principle.,The Commission adheres to that principle.,1
But obviously we cannot make that a general principle.,"Clearly, we can't adopt that as a universal rule.",1
"If we were to proceed according to this principle, the end results really would be totally absurd.",Following this principle would lead to utterly ridiculous outcomes.,1
And you cannot expect that of the Commission.,Such expectations of the Commission are not reasonable.,1
Public health policy,Policy on public health.,1
"Mr President, the development of the European public health policy has now reached a very important stage.","European public health policy has reached a crucial point in its development, Mr. President.",1
"The rest of the article is far from perfect, but provides the basis for some serious work over the next five years.","The article, despite its significant shortcomings, provides a starting point for extensive work in the following five years.",1
How should that work be organised?,What is the proposed method for organizing that work?,1
"Firstly, it is time for bold thinking.","Initially, it's a period for audacious ideas.",1
I also have in mind the need to address health factors which are exacerbated by decisions within the EU.,I am also considering the necessity to tackle health issues that worsen due to EU decisions.,1
I fear we are going to repeat that error in another report later this week.,I'm concerned we might make the same mistake in a different report soon.,1
We must work to end that in a sensible way.,We should strive to put an end to this in a reasonable manner.,1
"That leads to the second requirement, which is one of responsibility.","This brings us to the second prerequisite, which involves being responsible.",1
"As we all know, the Treaty of Rome made no provision at all in this area.",The area in question was completely left out of the Treaty of Rome.,1
It is hard to explain.,Explaining this is difficult.,1
"It is also hard, on the other hand, to expect countries to surrender sovereignty over their national health systems.","Alternatively, it's challenging to anticipate countries giving up authority over their domestic health services.",1
So what should be done?,What actions should we take?,1
Mr Needle's excellent report makes a series of timely and practical proposals.,Mr. Needle has presented a report full of practical and well-timed suggestions.,1
The current policy is ripe for review and the financial resources are regrettably very limited.,"It's time to reexamine this policy because the funds available are, regretfully, extremely limited.",1

"Take agriculture and transport, two areas where there is much to be gained.","Look into agriculture and transportation, sectors ripe with potential.",1
One final point on enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe.,One last comment regarding the enlargement involving Central and Eastern Europe.,1
The public health problems there are huge.,The area is facing enormous public health challenges.,1
It will take a great deal to bring their standards of public health up to our own.,A lot of effort is needed to elevate their public health to the level we have achieved.,1
And their standards have great implications for ours.,Their standards significantly affect ours.,1
So I hope the Commission will put a good deal of energy into solving the public health problems of Eastern Europe.,I expect the Commission to dedicate a lot of effort to resolve the public health challenges in Eastern Europe.,1
"Funding comes first and foremost, and Agenda 2000 is currently under discussion.","Currently, the main focus is on financing, while discussions about Agenda 2000 are underway.",1
"Secondly, cooperation with Member States and with international organisations involved in health protection must be strengthened.","Furthermore, our joint efforts with countries and worldwide health institutions in health protection should be intensified.",1
"Thirdly, we need to integrate our health policy with all other European policies.","Thirdly, our health policy must be intertwined with every other policy at the European level.",1
"The memory of the consequences of a misguided agricultural economic policy, namely the BSE problem, must surely be fresh in all our minds.","Surely, we haven't forgotten the BSE crisis, a direct consequence of faulty agricultural economic policies.",1
The European Union is in a position to promote and develop cooperation and information networks at all levels.,The European Union has the capacity to advance and cultivate information-sharing networks on various scales.,1
"Yet, as indicated by the Commission, this centre would allow us to react rapidly to threats to health.","As suggested by the Commission, the establishment of this center would permit swift reaction to health risks.",1
It is true that all progress involves risk.,Every advancement comes with risks.,1
This is where we must apply the cost/benefit principle by weighing the advantages against the disadvantages.,"In this instance, it is essential to use the cost/benefit principle to compare the positives with the negatives.",1
It is only if the disadvantages equal the advantages that we should use the precautionary principle.,We should only apply the precautionary principle when the drawbacks are balanced by the benefits.,1
This does not however mean in practice that these statements of principle are applied unreservedly.,"This, however, does not imply that these principles are always put into practice without reservations.",1
"Regrettably, the opposite was likewise demonstrated in the previous debate on electromagnetic fields.","Unfortunately, the previous debate on electromagnetic fields also showed the contrary.",1
"Firstly, we need to take into account all the inhabitants of this continent, both the sick and the healthy.","We must first consider every person on the continent, whether they are ill or not.",1
It is AIDS which has taught us these lessons in recent years.,Recent years have taught us these lessons through the experience of AIDS.,1
The Needle report on the European Union's new public health policy seems to ignore this fact completely.,The Needle report on the European Union's new public health policy appears to entirely disregard this particular fact.,1
"The Commission notes it, but talks of a large number of 'premature deaths' in Europe.",The Commission remarks on the considerable amount of 'premature deaths' occurring in Europe.,1
"What, I ask myself, is premature?","I wonder, what is considered premature?",1
"In the Commission proposal, the age of 68 is the critical threshold.","According to the proposal from the Commission, the pivotal age is 68.",1
"But we are forgetting that elsewhere in the world, life expectancy is far shorter.",We are overlooking the fact that life expectancy is significantly lower in other parts of the world.,1
"I would therefore like to see a limited budget, and I regard a separate directorate-general for public health as unnecessary.","Therefore, my preference is for a conservative budget and I believe establishing a separate directorate-general for public health is redundant.",1
"Mr President, one of the greatest dangers to our health comes from air pollution.","Mr. President, our health is greatly endangered by the pollution in the air.",1
Emissions into the atmosphere are catastrophic to health.,eleasing pollutants into the air severely harms human health,1
Up to 24 000 people in my country die prematurely each year due to this major hazard.,"In my country, as many as 24,000 lives are lost prematurely every year due to this serious risk.",1
We must harness the field of science to deliver rapid and affordable solutions today.,It's essential to utilize the domain of science to provide swift and economical solutions now.,1
This technology is available now.,We have this technology at our disposal currently.,1
It is our duty in the quest for improved public health to put it to use.,"In striving for enhanced public health, utilizing it is our responsibility.",1
"Of course it is already very broadly based at the present, but it must be said that employment is an important basis too for public health.","It is already widely established, however, employment remains a key element for public health as well.",1
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Needle has gone to great trouble with the hearing in committee.","The committee hearing involved considerable effort on the part of Mr. Needle, as noted by the President and the assembly.",1
I believe that the Member States have a very major responsibility.,I am of the opinion that the Member States bear a significant responsibility.,1
In my view only the Member States can take on this responsibility.,It is my belief that this obligation falls solely on the Member States.,1
So I would like to draw attention to a few points I am not happy with.,"Thus, I wish to highlight a few aspects with which I am discontented.",1
I also think we are not in a position to create equality in health.,I also believe it is not within our power to ensure equal health for everyone.,1
"There are very different ideas and considerations on, for instance, cures and treatments.","Different concepts and thoughts exist regarding, for example, treatments and cures.",1
I am glad we have these widely different approaches and also that we have freedom of movement.,The variety of approaches and our ability to move freely pleases me.,1
"After all, the Court of Justice has ruled that people can be treated differently in different countries.",The Court of Justice has established that it's lawful to differentiate between people in separate nations.,1
I want to retain this and would not like to see everything forced into line in Europe.,I aim to keep this and do not favor the idea of uniformity being imposed across Europe.,1
I would far rather see the responsibility left with the Member States.,Leaving the responsibility to the Member States is my strong preference.,1
I also believe that the regional authorities are not all in a position to establish contacts with the Commission.,I hold the view that networking with the Commission isn't possible for every regional authority.,1
I would like to see pilot projects.,I'm interested in observing pilot initiatives.,1
Only then could I approve the report.,I could endorse the report only under those circumstances.,1
"That is what Mr Needle's report seeks to do, and consequently we are happy to approve it.","Mr. Needle's report aims to achieve that, and so we gladly endorse it.",1
One fundamental aspect here is to recognise Parliament's role in determining and controlling the health budget.,Recognizing Parliament's pivotal role in the health budget's formation and supervision is crucial.,1
Then there are the problems of improving information and reacting to health threats.,Then there is the issue of enhancing information and responding to health risks.,1
"Mr President, there can be no doubt that public health policy is, to a very large extent, a national matter.","Mr. President, it is clear that public health policy largely falls under national jurisdiction.",1
Mr Needle's excellent report also makes this plain.,This is clearly articulated in Mr. Needle's exceptional report.,1
The report mentions best practice and standards in health care.,The report discusses optimal procedures and benchmarks in health care.,1
"In my view, this is the area where the Commission has an important role to play.","The Commission has an important role in this field, as I see it.",1
"In the business sector, best practice - known as 'benchmarking' - is an excellent way for businesses to maximise their performance.","Benchmarking, or what's known as best practice in the business industry, is a superb method for companies to enhance their performance.",1

The report also mentions agricultural policy and the BSE crisis.,The document references farming policy and the BSE situation.,1
"However, I think that support for tobacco growers is a matter of serious concern.","In my view, assisting tobacco growers is something we should be worried about.",1
Smoking already claims hundreds of thousands of victims every day.,"Every day, smoking is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of individuals.",1
So it seems unreasonable to support tobacco cultivation to the tune of EUR 1 billion every year.,Supporting the growth of tobacco with an annual funding of EUR 1 billion seems illogical.,1
The support should be phased out and transferred from agriculture to the regional policy budget.,The assistance ought to be gradually withdrawn and shifted from the agricultural sector to the budget for regional policy.,1
This would make it easier to reach a decision on providing support for alternative sources of employment.,This could simplify the decision-making process for supporting alternative employment options.,1
"In my view, there is a great deal we can do.",I believe there is much we can accomplish.,1
It is not efficient enough.,Its efficiency is not up to par.,1
So there is a great deal to do here.,"Consequently, we have a considerable amount of work to tackle here.",1
"Of course the Member States can also do it on their own behalf, but collating the findings would indeed produce a European added value.","While Member States have the capability to perform the task individually, combining the results would yield a benefit for Europe as a whole.",1
"In any case, there is no need to discuss that further.",Further discussion on that matter isn't necessary.,1
For that is certainly one of the problems.,"Certainly, that's one of the difficulties.",1
"I have been looking at the judgments pronounced in America against the cigarette industry, as you probably all have too.","You're probably aware that I, too, have been examining the legal verdicts in America against tobacco companies.",1
That would certainly shorten rather than extend their lifespan.,That would likely reduce their lifespan instead of increasing it.,1
That is in fact the point of departure we have chosen here and I am very glad all this has been properly understood.,"The starting point we've selected is that, and I am pleased it has been correctly comprehended.",1
"Since, thank God, we live in a democracy, this time it is for Parliament to cry mea culpa .","In our democratic society, thankfully, it is Parliament's turn to admit fault.",1

The dispute is becoming increasingly bitter and is beginning to look like a trade war.,The quarrel is intensifying in acrimony and seems to be evolving into a trade war.,1
It is becoming more and more absurd and putting the credibility of the WTO and its procedures as a whole at risk.,"The situation is increasingly ridiculous and endangers the trustworthiness of the WTO, along with its entire process.",1
The European Union put a new and revised banana regime in place on 1 January 1999.,"On the first day of January 1999, the European Union introduced a revised banana regime.",1
It did so after the WTO decided that the previous regime was not in conformity with WTO rules.,The change was initiated after the WTO found the old regime to be out of step with its rules.,1
"The USA continues to doubt whether even this new, revised complies with WTO rules.",The USA still questions whether this updated version adheres to WTO regulations.,1
That is its right.,It is entitled to that.,1
In so doing the United States is placing itself outside the multilateral legal system.,"The United States, through its actions, is positioning itself outside the collaborative international legal system.",1
Sanctions may not be imposed before the conclusion of the arbitration procedure.,Sanctions cannot be applied until the arbitration process is complete.,1

The European People's Party also finds that the USA has quite clearly breached the WTO rules.,The European People's Party holds the view that the USA has evidently broken the regulations of the WTO.,1
But that does not necessarily mean we know what will happen next.,"However, this doesn't ensure that we understand future events.",1
"Mr President, the quarrel between the USA and the EU runs very deep.","Mr President, the disagreement between the USA and the EU is quite significant.",1
It is no longer merely a question of bananas but threatens to affect EU/US trade on a much wider scale.,The issue has expanded beyond just bananas and now risks impacting EU/US trade relations more broadly.,1
"More than that, it could conceivably affect the very future of the WTO and tip the balance away from free trade to protectionism.","Furthermore, it is possible that this might impact the WTO's long-term future, pushing the scale from free trade towards protectionism.",1
For that and many other reasons we support the motion for a resolution.,There are multiple reasons for which we endorse the proposal for a resolution.,1
"At the same time, the European Parliament warned of the need for the European Union to make plans to retaliate against the US decision.","Simultaneously, the European Parliament cautioned that the European Union should prepare to respond to the US's decision.",1
Despite our appeals the Americans have carried out their threats.,Our appeals were in vain as the Americans proceeded with their threats.,1
The United States has shown that it holds negotiations in contempt.,The United States has demonstrated a lack of respect for engaging in negotiations.,1
We have to take action rather than insisting on an approach that is clearly not being respected.,We ought to do something rather than persist with a method that is evidently ignored.,1
"But the US, in threatening a trade boycott, is overstepping the bounds of that clear position and the bounds of the transatlantic partnership.",The US is surpassing the clearly defined limits and the scope of the transatlantic relationship by threatening a trade boycott.,1
"Once again, none of the parties, least of all the Caribbean banana producers, have anything to gain from a trade war.","A trade war would be to no party's benefit, particularly not to those producing bananas in the Caribbean.",1
"But I doubt it, because in recent years you have dealt with all manner of trade issues.","I'm skeptical, given that you've managed various trade-related matters in the past few years.",1
"So I ask you, where do we go from here?",What direction do we take moving forward?,1
Do we wait for the ruling of the WTO panel?,Do we await the decision from the WTO panel?,1
"Are Washington and Brussels going to talk, or is the EU going to pay the US back in the same coin?","Will there be a dialogue between Washington and Brussels, or will the EU respond to the US with similar measures?",1
"And if so, what coin will that be?","And should that be true, what will the coin refer to?",1
"Mr President, it is with bananas of all things that the USA is currently making huge efforts to dismantle the WTO.","Mr President, the USA is expending substantial efforts using bananas to undermine the WTO.",1

We too must adopt a Section 301.,A Section 301 must also be implemented by us.,1
"Mr President, I should first like to make a minor correction to what my good friend James Elles has just said.","Mr. President, I would like to make a small amendment to the statement made by my colleague James Elles.",1
This is something the CNN channel has been reiterating in a campaign on behalf of the United States.,CNN has been persistently echoing this message as part of a campaign for the United States.,1
"I am not sure if this is true of the United States, but Europe certainly is a major producer of bananas.","Europe is definitely a leading banana producer, though I'm uncertain about the United States.",1
The European Union is indeed a major producer of bananas.,The European Union is certainly a significant banana producer.,1
"I do however agree with everything else James Elles said and, of course, I agree entirely with Erika Mann.","However, I am in agreement with all other points made by James Elles, and I completely concur with Erika Mann as well.",1
The Union is currently involved in a legal dispute.,There is a current legal conflict involving the Union.,1
It is as if someone were to steal my wallet and I were then expected to sit down and negotiate with him.,Imagine having to sit and discuss terms with the individual who just swiped your wallet.,1
"If someone stole my wallet, I would go straight to the police, I would not sit down and negotiate with the thief.","Should my wallet be taken, I'd make a beeline for law enforcement instead of discussing terms with the robber.",1
The Union is not involved in a political process at this juncture.,"Currently, the Union is not engaged in a political process.",1
What we are involved in is essentially a legal process.,We are essentially engaged in a process of law.,1
The time to sit down and negotiate will be after the World Trade Organisation has decided on the solution.,Negotiations should commence subsequent to the World Trade Organisation's decision on the solution.,1
And this is understandable.,And one can comprehend this.,1
"So, let us take the gloves off.","Therefore, let's not hold back.",1
"No more softly, softly on Helms-Burton.",No more gentle approach regarding Helms-Burton.,1
"Who can now have faith in the WTO and its disputes settlement procedure, in particular the developing world.","Who can maintain confidence in the WTO's method of resolving disputes, especially countries in development?",1
"The ACP countries represent a pledge made by the European Union, a pledge that it has to honoured.",The ACP countries are a promise from the European Union that must be kept.,1
We have already given in to the World Trade Organisation on many occasions.,"Time and again, we have submitted to the demands of the World Trade Organisation.",1
What is the aim?,What is the goal?,1
It is indeed the case that the companies concerned already have some 70 % and more of the market.,The companies in question already possess over 70% of the market share.,1
It is not the case that they are being excluded from Europe in any sense of the word.,They are not being barred from participation in Europe in any context.,1
We shall not only condemn them.,We will do more than just criticize them.,1
"We shall, as we have done, take them to the WTO and follow the consequences of that action.","As before, we will bring them to the WTO and deal with the outcomes.",1
I believe I have worked as hard as anybody not only to maintain but to develop those relations.,I'm convinced that I've put in as much effort as anyone to not just preserve but also enhance those connections.,1
We all have our nemeses in due course.,"Eventually, we each encounter our own adversaries.",1
It affects people and it reaches them at different times and on different issues.,"It has an effect on people, influencing them at various times and regarding different matters.",1
"On that basis, nemesis can be avoided.","With such a foundation, we can prevent retribution.",1
"However, let us, in avoiding that nemesis in this way, also recognise that wiser counsels exist.","Yet, as we steer clear of that downfall, we must admit that there are more sensible counsels to consider.",1
It is our task to ensure that wiser counsels prevail.,It is our responsibility to guarantee the dominance of better judgment.,1
"Thank you, Commissioner, we are behind you.","Thank you, Commissioner, we stand with you.",1
I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2).,Eight motions for resolutions have been presented to me as per Rule 37(2).,1
Own resources,Self-generated funds.,1
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy first has a point of order.,Mr. Fabre-Aubrespy has a procedural issue to raise first.,1
"As I understand it, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you wish this item to be removed from the agenda.","Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you want to eliminate this point from our agenda, if I'm not mistaken.",1
I can now give the floor to one speaker in favour and one against.,One proponent and one opponent are now allowed to take the floor.,1
A pirate electronic version is available but not in French.,"An unauthorized digital copy can be found, although it isn't available in French.",1
I put to the vote Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's motion to remove this item from the agenda.,I called for a vote on Mr. Fabre-Aubrespy's motion to delete this item from the agenda.,1
"In addition to the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy, the financing of the Community needs to undergo radical reform.",The financing of the Community should be thoroughly reformed beyond the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy.,1
President Santer rightly pointed out that financial reform is one of the main pillars of Agenda 2000.,"A fundamental component of Agenda 2000, as stated by President Santer, is fiscal reform.",1
The financing structure we have at present no longer matches up to the increased demands made on it.,Our present financial system fails to meet the escalated demands.,1
"We need greater flexibility, transparency and autonomy in the European financial system.","The European financial system demands more autonomy, transparency, and the ability to adapt.",1
The Committee on Budgets therefore proposes a step-by-step readjustment of the own resources system.,The Budgets Committee is therefore recommending that the own resources system be incrementally modified.,1
This measure will also help eliminate the imbalances between Member States in relation to funding the budget.,The measure will assist in eradicating disparities in budget funding across Member States.,1
"Secondly, in principle the European budget must be financed under the same conditions for all Member States.","Moreover, the European budget requires, in theory, uniform financing conditions for all participating countries.",1
"But at that time the agricultural proportion of the budget, accounting for over 70 %, was considerably higher than it is today.","Agriculture once took up more than 70% of the budget, a figure that has noticeably decreased nowadays.",1
But we cannot achieve this important aim on the expenditure side.,This significant objective cannot be realized only through expenditure.,1
Such an attempt would merely create rules that would make the budget complicated and less transparent.,An attempt of this nature would only lead to the establishment of rules that would obscure and complicate the budget.,1
We want horizontal justice and vertical solidarity to be our principle for shaping the budget.,Our budget creation principle is based on fairness in every aspect and cooperation at every level.,1
"Fourthly, ever widening imbalances have emerged in the course of time in the financing of the budget.",There have been increasing disparities over time in how the budget is financed.,1
They now form a considerable obstacle to the development of the European Union.,They now pose a significant barrier to the growth of the European Union.,1
You can see that just by looking at the current discussions in the Council.,Observation of the Council's current debates reveals this.,1
"To put it plainly: there will always be net contributors and net beneficiaries, nobody disputes that.","Clearly, the existence of net contributors and net beneficiaries is a fact that is not contested.",1
But we must avoid excessive imbalances and unfair distributions of the burden.,But it's important to steer clear of significant disparities and inequitable allocation of responsibilities.,1
Otherwise there is a risk that our people will doubt the legitimacy of the Union.,"If not, people might question whether the Union is legitimate.",1
It is all the more important to have rules that include agriculture because that is where many of these imbalances stem from.,"Given that many imbalances originate in agriculture, it's particularly vital to establish regulations that encompass this sector.",1
In this context let me also emphasise again that cofinancing does not mean renationalisation - on the contrary.,"I must highlight once again in this context that cofinancing should not be confused with renationalisation; rather, it's quite the reverse.",1
Nobody would even think of denying the Community nature of our structural policy.,No one would consider disputing the collective aspect of our structural policy.,1
"This compromise did not obtain a majority, for which those who strongly rejected cofinancing bear particular responsibility.","The compromise failed to secure a majority, and particular blame lies with those who vehemently opposed cofinancing.",1
Primarily this revenue would consist of own taxes.,"Basically, this income would come from taxes it establishes.",1
We have nearly achieved this new quality of Communitisation with the completion of economic and monetary union.,"With the economic and monetary union almost finalized, we have almost attained this new level of integration within the Community.",1
The Member States' economies are interwoven in a particular manner.,The economies of the Member States are intertwined in a specific way.,1
That means that the Member States' budgets and the European budget can no longer be looked at in isolation from one another.,The Member States' budgets and the European budget are no longer separate entities for consideration.,1
When we vote on this report we will also be deciding our own ability to act.,Our vote on this report will determine our capacity for action.,1
Support us along this new road and let us dare to embark on it together.,Join us on this new journey and let us have the courage to take it on together.,1
"Mr President, I would be prepared to support the revolution but it is actually the opposite which is being proposed.","Mr. President, I could back the revolution, yet what's being suggested is actually the reverse.",1
Work that one out if you can!,Figure that out if possible!,1
"The main proposal of your report, Mrs Haug, is therefore contrary to the Treaty.","Mrs. Haug, the key recommendation of your report opposes the Treaty.",1
It is abundantly clear that the Commission's communication does not exhaust all possible solutions.,"Clearly, the Commission's communication hasn't explored every possible answer.",1
I am sure when we come to the vote you will see how impossible that position has proved to be.,I am confident that the impracticality of that stance will be evident when we vote.,1
Her original drafts resulted in 241 amendments.,Her initial versions brought about 241 changes.,1
That shows there was more than a little interest.,It indicates a significant level of interest.,1
The last thing we wanted to do was to come before Parliament with so many amendments to be voted on.,It wasn't our intention to present so many amendments for Parliament to vote on.,1
So we asked the rapporteur to try to obtain as many compromise amendments as possible.,We requested the rapporteur to attempt securing the maximum number of compromise amendments.,1
And that is exactly what she did.,She did just that.,1
She then put together a revised draft.,She subsequently composed an updated version.,1
And that is what the Socialist Group has tried to go along with.,The Socialist Group has attempted to support that.,1
She has done very well.,She has succeeded considerably.,1
The one thing my group can agree on is that the status quo needs to be changed.,My group is united in the belief that we need to alter the current situation.,1
It has not developed in any systematic way nor in accordance with any European strategy or real forward planning.,It has grown without systematic structure or conformance to a strategic European plan or foresight.,1
"Rather, it has developed as a reaction to events at given periods of time.",It evolved as a response to specific events over different periods.,1
I will give you a couple of examples.,I'm going to provide you with two examples.,1
The original traditional own resources was the one truly European own resource.,The initial traditional own resources constituted the only truly European resource.,1
At the same time that one truly European own resource is waning rapidly in its importance.,"Simultaneously, one resource that is uniquely European diminishes in importance.",1
Try to explain it to members of the general public and - even if you can do it - how are they to understand it?,"Attempt to make this understandable to the general populace and, even if you succeed, how will they grasp it?",1
That is the situation that exists.,That's the current state of affairs.,1
We have a system of own resources that is extremely complex and lacking in transparency.,Our own resource system is marred by excessive complexity and a lack of clarity.,1
All this Parliament wants is a clear and comprehensible system.,This Parliament merely seeks a clear and understandable system.,1
We are somewhere near to getting an agreement on that through Mrs Haug's report.,We are nearing an agreement on the subject of Mrs Haug's report.,1
I would hope that at the end of the voting we have a clear and concise position and most of my group will be supporting it.,"I'm optimistic that after the vote, we'll have a well-defined stance supported by the majority of my faction.",1
"Mr President, I wish to move a procedural motion.","Mr. President, I intend to propose a procedural motion.",1
"You are right, Mr Giansily, that there is a tremendous problem every time we change the agenda.","Indeed, Mr. Giansily, altering the agenda invariably brings about a significant problem.",1
"It makes life very difficult for Members, Commissioners and the press.","For Members, Commissioners, and the media, this is a complicating factor.",1
"But if you insist that we take a vote on the matter, then of course it can be done.","Should you firmly request it, a vote on the issue is indeed possible.",1
"I think you are quite right in that respect, although I would point out that Mr Bourlanges has also spoken, as well as Mr Valdivielso.","I agree with you on that point, and would also mention that both Mr. Bourlanges and Mr. Valdivielso have given their input.",1
"Do you insist on having a vote, Mr Giansily?","Mr Giansily, are you demanding that we vote?",1
"Yes, Mr President, I am asking for a vote.","Indeed, Mr. President, I am requesting a vote.",1
"Mr President, I just wanted to propose a compromise.","Mr President, I simply wanted to suggest a middle ground.",1
I think seven groups still have to speak and there are only a few minutes left.,"Seven groups have yet to speak, and the time is nearly up.",1
Perhaps we could come to a compromise.,Maybe it's possible for us to reach an agreement.,1
"After all, you do not have to work through the whole list of speakers.","After all, it's not necessary to go through the entire speaker list.",1
"One speaker per group, Mr President.","Mr. President, each group should have a single speaker.",1
"Mr President, I should like to make a further remark.","Mr. President, I would like to add another comment.",1
"I am one of those paying the price for this, as I am will now have to speak in the evening.","This has affected me, and as a result, I'm now scheduled to speak in the evening.",1
"Mr President, I would suggest that we continue the debate here in plenary immediately after Question Time.","Mr. President, I propose that the discussion in the plenary session resumes right after Question Time.",1
I put to the vote Mr Giansily's request for the political group spokesmen to be given the floor before Question Time.,"The proposal to allow statements from political group spokespersons before Question Time, as requested by [Name0] [Surname1], is submitted to the vote.",1
One should at least check whether this 10 % can be appropriated for the customs administrations in the first place.,One should verify if the customs administrations can actually use this 10%.,1
VAT-based own resources are tending increasingly to take the form of national contributions to the EU budget.,Own resources derived from VAT are increasingly resembling national contributions to the European Union's budget.,1
Their share is being distorted because of the size of the black economy in some states.,"In some states, the black economy's magnitude is skewing their share.",1
GNP-based own resources still correspond most closely to contributions.,It's the own resources tied to GNP that best resemble contributions.,1
But I am sorry that the net-contributor issue is not being resolved at all.,I regret that the issue of net-contributors remains completely unresolved.,1
"Mr President, I should also like to compliment Mrs Haug on her report.","Mr. President, I'd like to extend my compliments to Mrs. Haug for her report as well.",1
These are very fundamental points for the future.,These matters are essential for what lies ahead.,1
In that respect it is a report of fundamental importance which we should welcome.,We should recognize the report's critical significance in this context.,1
Obviously there are a number of points which cause difficulties.,"Clearly, several issues present challenges.",1
The issue of cofinancing will clearly be shared by a large majority of my group.,A significant portion of my group will undoubtedly agree on the matter of cofinancing.,1
I would take issue with Mr Bourlanges who says it is illegal.,I would contest Mr. Bourlanges' claim of illegality.,1
He said so in so many words.,He expressed it outright.,1
It is not illegal.,It's not against the law.,1
It is the review of a policy which should remain communautaire .,The policy’s reassessment ought to remain under communal governance.,1
It is a question of appropriateness and of review.,The issue concerns suitability and examination.,1
There will certainly be individual items with which we may disagree.,"Certainly, some aspects may not align with our opinions.",1
It is clear also that not everybody would be happy to phase out the UK rebate right away.,"Clearly, the immediate cessation of the UK rebate wouldn't please everyone.",1
We have heard that point before.,That's a familiar point.,1
That is a very positive point.,That's a highly positive aspect.,1
"Our colleague, Mr Colom i Naval will have considerable support for the issue of having more flexibility and transparency.","Our colleague, Mr. Colom i Naval, will be strongly backed on the topic of enhancing flexibility and transparency.",1
"Mr President, thank you for having agreed to put our proposals to the vote.","Mr President, thanks for agreeing to allow our suggestions to be voted on.",1
This report boils down to just a few questions.,This report essentially comes down to a handful of questions.,1
Are the own resources that allow Community policies to be financed still sufficient?,Are the Community's own resources still enough to cover its policy financing?,1
Do they guarantee the financial autonomy of the European Union?,Do they ensure the EU's financial independence?,1
What policies and at what level?,What kind of policies and at which governance level?,1
"Or, in other words, to use an expression we have often used, we must have the means to realise our ambitions.","In other words, we need the resources to achieve what we aspire to.",1
These questions cannot be avoided.,These questions are inescapable.,1
"We must, after all, ensure a fresh distribution of the available resources between producers and regions.",It is our responsibility to guarantee a new allocation of existing resources among producers and areas.,1
"Furthermore, there are other job-creation projects which cannot be delayed, and they also call for additional funding.","Additionally, other projects intended to create jobs cannot be postponed and similarly necessitate more funding.",1
I would say that this is the central issue: how the European Union is to be properly financed.,The key question is how to ensure suitable financing for the European Union.,1
That is the fundamental mistake in what is called the communitised agricultural policy.,The agricultural policy termed 'communitised' is based on an essential flaw.,1
In that respect I warmly thank the Committee on Budgets for nailing its colours to the mast!,"In this regard, I express my hearty thanks to the Committee on Budgets for taking a strong and visible position.",1
"Mr President, the characteristic feature of our four own resources is that they are inappropriate. There are three reasons for this.","The defining trait of our four distinct resources is their inappropriateness, which can be attributed to three main factors.",1
This is true of both VAT and GNP.,The statement applies to VAT as well as GNP.,1
"Secondly, they are not clear or transparent.","Furthermore, they lack clarity and transparency.",1
It is now intended to alter this system under pressure due to enlargement to the East and pressure from Germany.,"The system is set to be modified, influenced by the eastward expansion and Germany's insistence.",1
The European Commission has made a number of proposals.,The European Commission has put forward several suggestions.,1
"In fact, these own resources are serving to reveal the truth.",These own resources are actually making the truth known.,1
Only one thing can protect us from this unfortunate fate and that is the rule of unanimity.,Unanimity is our singular defense against such a dire destiny.,1
"Thank you, Mr Martinez.","I appreciate it, Mr. Martinez.",1
We shall adjourn the debate at this point.,"At this time, we will pause the discussion.",1
It will be resumed this evening at 9 p.m.,It's going to start again tonight at nine.,1
The next item is questions to the Commission (B4-0144/99).,"Subsequently, the agenda includes a question session directed at the Commission (B4-0144/99).",1

It has a sign to that effect outside and the two vehicles I referred to have Commission logos on them.,"A sign outside confirms this, and the two vehicles I mentioned carry the Commission's logos.",1
To the outside world it appears to be a Commission office and people in the village refer to it as a Commission office.,"On the outside, it seems to be a Commission office, which is how village residents refer to it.",1
I do not accept the answer I was given and the people who I spoke to thought that they were still employed by the Commission.,"The answer I received was unsatisfactory, and those I talked to believed they were still part of the Commission.",1
I can only reiterate what I have asked in the original question.,I have no choice but to repeat the query I initially made.,1
This situation needs to be investigated urgently.,It is imperative that we conduct an investigation into this situation without delay.,1
If there is a misunderstanding then the people should be put right who think that they are in arrears of salary.,"If there's a misconception, then those who believe they're behind on their wages should be corrected.",1
I am unaware of the reasons behind this situation you describe though I can make an educated guess at them.,"Although I'm not informed about the causes of this scenario you mention, I'm capable of speculating on them.",1

European exports rose during that period but the situation has now been rectified.,"Exports from Europe increased in that time frame, but the issue has since been resolved.",1
"The only product of any significance is canned tomatoes, but even they account for no more than 7 % of the market.","Canned tomatoes stand out as the sole notable product, yet their market share does not exceed 7%.",1

How much further do you want it to fall?,How much lower do you expect it to go?,1
"Let us just reflect on the fact that, without a common agricultural policy, there would be no European Union today.",Consider that the European Union wouldn't exist today without a shared agricultural policy.,1
We must accept that contributions are determined by the single market as a whole and not just by the Community budget.,"The single market collectively decides our contributions, not just the Community budget.",1
But it has no clear thrust.,"However, its main point is not apparent.",1
"In order to develop that, the report should really be referred back to committee.",The report needs to be returned to the committee to be developed.,1
For when it comes to collecting revenue we see particularly large losses in the Member States as a result of irregularities and fraud.,Significant revenue losses in Member States stem from both irregularities and fraudulent activities.,1
The discussion showed that extensively enough.,The debate made that abundantly clear.,1
"The way I read this report, Mrs Haug has tried to propose short and medium-term measures.","Mrs. Haug has made attempts to recommend measures for the short and medium term, as I interpret this report.",1
It will not be the last report by the Committee on Budgets to cause us problems.,We will encounter more issues with subsequent reports from the Committee on Budgets.,1
"With this report we certainly are, which is why we should support it on Thursday.","Given this report, we are indeed assured, and so we should cast our support on Thursday.",1
I congratulate Mrs Haug for this balanced combination of those issues: short-term realism and long-term vision.,I commend Mrs. Haug for adeptly mixing practical short-term concerns with long-term strategic thinking.,1
"With regard to specific new own resources, positions still differ considerably.",There remains a significant divergence of opinions on the matter of specific new own resources.,1
These differences have also manifested themselves within the European Parliament.,These disparities have become evident within the European Parliament too.,1
Intellectually it is very interesting but politically there are not very many realistic options today.,"Though it's intellectually engaging, the realistic political choices today are sparse.",1
Timing is important here.,"In this scenario, timing is a key element.",1
I once again congratulate the rapporteur for her excellent work.,I extend my congratulations to the report author for her outstanding contribution.,1
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen.","I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Liikanen.",1
Transportable pressure equipment,Pressure equipment that can be transported.,1
"But it would be appropriate to guarantee notified inspection bodies a right of control, as outlined in our amendments.","Inspection bodies that received notifications should be granted a right to oversee, consistent with the amendments we have proposed.",1
The possibility of granting a transitional period has also been raised.,There has also been discussion about allowing a transitional phase.,1
"We believe that this too is acceptable, provided that no extensions are granted.","We consider it acceptable, on the condition that extensions are not permitted.",1
There are other less important changes on top of these.,"Besides these, there are additional minor changes.",1
Some merely refer to purely linguistic and formal aspects.,Others focus only on aspects that are strictly linguistic and structural.,1
Both high safety levels and the elimination of technical difficulties can be achieved with this report.,This report allows for the accomplishment of high safety measures and the removal of technical hindrances.,1
The result of his efforts has been improvement in the Commission's proposal.,His efforts resulted in the Commission's proposal getting better.,1
The sight of Mr Jarzembowski always disorientates me.,Mr. Jarzembowski's presence always confuses me.,1
"We are not, however, able to accept Amendment No 1.","However, we cannot agree to Amendment Number 1.",1
"Since Amendment No 4 is a consequence of Amendment No 1, that too is not acceptable.","Amendment No 4, being a result of Amendment No 1, is also unacceptable.",1
Ports and intermodal terminals,Harbors and multimodal hubs.,1
"Mr President, perhaps I will not need my whole seven minutes of speaking time.","Mr. President, I might not require the full seven minutes to speak.",1
"After all, one can keep it a bit shorter.","Ultimately, it can be made somewhat more concise.",1
"We transport politicians always try to be precise, without letting things get out of hand.","As politicians involved in transportation, we always strive for precision while keeping things under control.",1
I would never go so far as to say that.,I would never make such a strong statement.,1
Immediately took rather longer than we would normally understand by the word.,Took a considerably longer amount of time than we usually anticipate.,1
The market is crucial to the development of seaports.,Seaports depend heavily on the market for their growth.,1
"What is totally incomprehensible, however, is the Commission's specifications for seaports.","However, the Commission's criteria for seaports are completely mystifying.",1
"We, and indeed I, regard that as totally wrong.","That is considered by us, and especially by me, as absolutely incorrect.",1
"To make it quite clear what infrastructure means, my report proposes a basic definition of the term.","In my report, I provide a fundamental explanation of 'infrastructure' to clarify its meaning.",1
"But if these are to be kept in check, we must also have a basic definition of what infrastructure means in the future networks.",To control these elements under control necessitates a clear understanding of infrastructure in upcoming networks.,1
The situation regarding inland ports is somewhat different.,The circumstances of inland ports differ to some extent.,1
The Transport Committee is adding that criterion to the report.,The Transport Committee is responsible for including that criterion in the report.,1
There are two other points I would like to address.,I want to discuss two additional points.,1
The Commission also wants to include rail freight freeways in the TENs.,"In addition, the Commission has the desire to add rail freight corridors into the TENs framework.",1
"Parliament has always supported the Commission and you personally, Commissioner, on the matter of freeways.","The Parliament has consistently been in support of the Commission's, and your personal, stance on freeway matters.",1
We think this is necessary in order to move more freight from the roads to the railways.,"In our opinion, it is imperative to shift a larger volume of freight traffic from road transport to rail transport.",1
And we continue to support you.,We remain in support of you.,1
"However, by virtue of their construction, the freeways are a service installation and not an infrastructure.","However, because of how they are built, the freeways act as a facility for service rather than infrastructure.",1
Then there is the famous project No 8 of the 14 very important projects endorsed by the Essen summit.,Then there's the well-known project number 8 among the 14 essential projects approved at the Essen summit.,1
"For God's sake, these projects have been examined a thousand times as to whether they can go ahead!",These projects have already undergone numerous evaluations to see if they are viable!,1
"The Christophersen Group went to great trouble, and now everything is to be changed again!","After the Christophersen Group's extensive efforts, there's going to be another round of changes.",1
This is certainly not a glorious chapter in the annals of the Council.,This part of the Council's history is definitely not admirable.,1
And that is the basis on which we should decide tomorrow.,That should be what guides our decision tomorrow.,1
We think that is wrong.,We believe that isn't right.,1
We have worked on the networks too long for this to happen.,"After our lengthy involvement with the networks, we didn't expect this to happen.",1
That is why it is useful to have the completed proposal on the table now.,"For this reason, having the proposal completely prepared and available right now is advantageous.",1
We did not get as far as how ports should be included in the master plan.,We didn't reach the point of discussing the inclusion of ports in the master plan.,1
The report on short-sea shipping demonstrated that.,The short-sea shipping report confirmed that.,1
There is a need for development all over Europe.,Progress is necessary across the whole of Europe.,1
We are now jointly picking out some priorities and some ports.,We're currently selecting certain priorities and ports together.,1
"Another point is that the selection of ports should be based on strategic considerations, and not just on regional and local factors.",The choice of ports should consider strategic factors rather than just regional or local aspects.,1
"A port may have great local significance, but it may not live up to the idea of a trans-European network.",A port may be of considerable local importance without necessarily fitting into the concept of a trans-European network.,1
"I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, very warmly for his report.","My warmest thanks go to the rapporteur, Mr. Piecyk, for his report.",1
That is a most important task and ensures that we do not have two different legal acts and follow different courses.,This essential task prevents the creation of two different legal acts and ensures we're not following divergent paths.,1
"I admit that, Commissioner, and also thank the Commission for improving its proposal compared to the original text.","Indeed, Commissioner, I recognize this, and thank the Commission for the enhanced proposal they've put forth from the original.",1
"In that respect, we have come closer to one another.",We've narrowed the gap between us in this regard.,1
I think that is the crucial point.,"In my opinion, that's a pivotal issue.",1
That means we need clear definitions of port infrastructure and port superstructure.,"Therefore, we require precise explanations for what constitutes port infrastructure and the superstructure of a port.",1
"I hope the Commission, Mr Kinnock, will agree with our more precise definition of project No 8.",I trust that Mr. Kinnock and the Commission will concur with our sharper definition of project No 8.,1
Unfortunately No 8 was a generally applicable commitment.,"Regrettably, commitment number eight was broadly applicable.",1
We need a brief report summarising the experience gained and a clear review.,A short summary of the experiences and a distinct evaluation are necessary.,1
That is our task and I believe the Commissioner should do us that favour.,It is our responsibility and the Commissioner should accommodate our request.,1
"The importance of ports is determined not only by history, but also by the ease of their links to the hinterland.",Historical factors and hinterland connectivity both play roles in defining port significance.,1
"Why, for example, is the port of Oporto rather less busy than that of Rotterdam?","For instance, why does the port of Oporto not experience as much traffic as Rotterdam’s port?",1
We should be very glad to see the Commission stressing the importance of these waterways as well.,We would appreciate the Commission highlighting the importance of these waterways as well.,1
The project now submitted could be regarded as a genuine revolution in the world of transport as far as Portugal is concerned.,The submitted project could be seen as a true breakthrough in transport for Portugal.,1
"I am broadly in agreement with this proposal, and I think that a compromise should be possible on one point.",I generally support this proposal and believe we can reach a compromise on a certain aspect.,1
Intermodality is a key factor.,Intermodality plays a crucial role.,1
That is the case with the multimodal link between Portugal and Spain and the rest of Europe.,"This applies to the multimodal link connecting Portugal, Spain, and the wider European region.",1
So where does that leave us?,So what does that mean for our situation?,1
Are there three or four corridors?,"Does the number of corridors amount to three, or is it actually four?",1
Which text accurately reflects the current political will of the Portuguese Government?,What document truly represents the Portuguese Government's current political intentions?,1
Which of them can we rely on in the future?,"In the future, which of them will prove to be reliable?",1
The rail network in southern Portugal is the worst in Europe as there are no links with Seville or with Faro airport.,Southern Portugal's train network is inferior in Europe due to its lack of links to Seville and Faro's airport.,1
We have now had enough inertia and vacillation.,Enough time has been wasted with inaction and indecisiveness.,1
I want to make a candid and as full as possible response to what has been said because these are important issues.,"In response to the significant points raised, I aim to provide a transparent and comprehensive reply.",1
So I hope the House will bear with me if I stray a little over the five minutes.,I'm hoping for the House's understanding if my time goes a bit beyond five minutes.,1
That would be very good.,It would be excellent.,1
"A number of amendments adopted by the committee can be accepted either in their entirety or, at least, in principle.",The adjustments proposed by the committee are acceptable in full or in their basic concept.,1
I understand that view very well.,I am very familiar with that perspective.,1
We are therefore fulfilling that requirement.,"Therefore, we are complying with that stipulation.",1
So investment in infrastructure will certainly help to deliver better services.,"Investing in infrastructure will, without doubt, result in improved services.",1
"If that was accepted, I hope that all parts of this House could then give support to the reference.","Assuming it is agreed upon, I trust that every section of this House would then endorse the reference.",1
"Those proposed amendments cannot, therefore, be accepted entirely.","Thus, it's not possible to fully accept the suggested changes.",1
"Amendment No 6 makes more radical changes to the guideline maps, adding new links and creating new categories of ports.","The sixth amendment substantially reworks the guideline maps, adding fresh links and instituting new categories for ports.",1
"Consequently, I cannot accept that amendment for that reason.","Therefore, I must reject that amendment due to that specific reason.",1
Amendment No 5 mainly tightens up definitions and can be readily accepted.,"Primarily, Amendment 5 makes definitions stricter and is easily agreeable.",1
I am grateful to Mr Piecyk for putting that amendment.,I appreciate Mr. Piecyk for proposing the amendment.,1
All I would regret was his prolonged absence from this House.,His extended absence from this House would be my only regret.,1
I will illustrate the point by taking the argument further.,"To demonstrate the point, I'll proceed with the argument.",1
"What you have just offered us, namely to reject all the proposals we submitted, is outrageous!",The suggestion to dismiss every proposal we put forward that you just proposed is scandalous!,1
But perhaps we will be meeting again next year!,Maybe we'll see each other again next year!,1
"Mr President, I have a similar, short question.","Mr President, my question is brief and along the same lines.",1
The Commissioner did not accept the amendments on the specific inland waterway links with ports.,The Commissioner rejected the changes regarding the particular connections of inland waterways with harbors.,1
"Mr President, I will be extremely brief because I am conscious of the fact that unavoidably my first contribution was long.","Mr. President, my comments will be quite brief this time as I'm aware that my initial contribution was unavoidably lengthy.",1
"Firstly, I entirely sympathise with the point that Mr Wijsenbeek makes.",I fully understand the point raised by Mr. Wijsenbeek.,1
"This, however, is not the proposal before the House.","However, the current proposal is different from this.",1
It is not a general revision of the trans-European network strategy.,This isn't an overhaul of the strategy for trans-European networks.,1
"It does, however, mean, that I owe the Parliament my honest judgment.","This means, however, that I must provide my truthful evaluation to Parliament.",1
"That he always gets, whether he likes it or not.",He receives it regardless of his preference.,1
"Happily, he likes it more often than he dislikes it!","He finds it more agreeable than not, to his delight!",1
"However, it also highlighted several important points.","Nevertheless, it underscored a number of significant aspects.",1
"Last of all, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to underline three things.","Lastly, there are three important points I would like to highlight.",1
"Firstly, the reports being debated this evening in joint debate are harmonised and complement each other.",The reports under discussion tonight are coordinated and mutually supportive.,1
"Thirdly, this is a significant milestone in the liberalisation of this important form of transport in Europe.","Thirdly, this signifies a notable development in the liberalization of this vital mode of transport within Europe.",1
I hope that the solidarity that was shown in the Committee on Transport and Tourism will still be there tomorrow during the vote.,I'm optimistic that the supportive spirit in the Transport and Tourism Committee will persist in tomorrow's voting session.,1
"Commissioner, I do not know what you will say; as a democrat of course I have to accept it.","Commissioner, while your forthcoming statement remains unclear to me, my democratic principles require acceptance.",1
But I would certainly be sorry to see all the amendments simply dismissed out of hand.,"However, I would regret if all the amendments were outright rejected.",1
That is not true and in principle I agree with the ideas put forward by the Commissioner and the Commission.,"The statement is incorrect, yet fundamentally, the Commissioner's and the Commission's ideas have my agreement.",1
In that regard I have taken several aspects into account.,I have considered multiple factors in that context.,1
And I can understand that the unions and the railway undertakings are highlighting this.,I get that the unions along with the railway companies are emphasizing this point.,1
"But privatisation does not even come into question in this context, it is not being proposed.",The idea of privatizing is not being considered in this scenario.,1
We can certainly consider liberalisation up to a certain point.,"Certainly, we could think about liberalization to an extent.",1
"I would prefer to say something different, in relation to our proposals: it is a question of Europeanising the railway system.","In discussing our proposals, I'd rather talk about something else: making the railway system European.",1
"Air transport has been Europeanised, all the undertakings have been Europeanised, there is a common market.","Air travel operates under a European framework, with all companies integrated and sharing a unified market.",1
That is untenable!,That cannot be sustained!,1
So I entirely support the Commission's basic premise and its proposals on opening up the market.,I am in full agreement with the foundation of the Commission's argument and their market liberalization suggestions.,1
Of course we do not want new monopolies to emerge.,"Naturally, the creation of new monopolies is undesirable.",1
"It is a question of the transparency of the decisions, the transparency of the allocations.",This concerns making both the decision process and the funding allocations transparent.,1
"Although this sector has not been regulated, it is certainly also a question of technical framework conditions.","Even if this sector lacks regulation, technical framework conditions are certainly involved.",1
So we need harmonisation in the technical field too.,Technical areas require us to harmonize as well.,1
"I come now to a central point, where my opinion differs from that of the Commission.","I now reach a pivotal issue, which is where my views diverge from those of the Commission.",1
In particular it concerns the large number of both central and decentralised rules.,"Specifically, it relates to the numerous rules that are both centralized and decentralized.",1
I believe the Commission has done a very good job in many cases.,I think the Commission has been quite successful in various instances.,1
"As for the charging principles, here again I agree with the Commission: on principle marginal charges should be required.","Regarding the principles on fees, I am in alignment with the Commission that generally, minimal charges should be imposed.",1
"However, I have deleted the detailed rules on this from the report.",I've removed the specific regulations regarding this matter from the document.,1
Each country should continue to be able to regulate this as it wishes in its area of jurisdiction.,Each nation should retain the ability to regulate this in its own jurisdiction as it sees fit.,1
I think that is the essential point.,I believe that's the crucial aspect.,1
It is vital for the railways also to show that they are willing to reform and to make the appropriate reforms.,"For the railways, it's critical to not only express a willingness to reform but also to carry out the right reforms.",1
"Personally, I should like to see a number of other requirements deleted.",I would like to see several other requirements removed.,1
I do not believe it is possible to forcibly increase efficiency by means of highly detailed directives from Brussels.,I have my doubts that issuing extensive directives from Brussels will effectively force an improvement in efficiency.,1
Or is that really the case?,Or is that actually true?,1
"As Mr Wibe has just been saying, there are problems.",Mr Wibe has just mentioned that there are issues.,1
It is a long way from decision to reality.,There's a significant distance between making decisions and seeing them come to life.,1
Consideration for public services and social obligations make the consequences difficult for many people.,Public service factors and social commitments make the outcomes challenging for a lot of individuals.,1
"Many countries and regions are worried, and perhaps with reason.","Various places around the world are experiencing worry, possibly for good reasons.",1
We should bear that in mind.,That should be kept in consideration.,1
"But the opportunity for the renaissance of the railways is at hand, and that is what we should strive for.","However, the chance to revive the railways is here, and that's our goal.",1
That is our goal.,This is what we aim for.,1
The goal is to ensure that an appropriate share of all transport work goes to the railways.,The aim is to guarantee a suitable percentage of transportation is conducted by trains.,1
We must solve the problems of this process together with our citizens.,"Together with our citizens, we must resolve the issues associated with this procedure.",1
I believe we should be aware of the fact that changes and market developments do not happen by themselves.,We must acknowledge that market shifts and developments don't just occur on their own.,1
We have to prompt them in one way or another.,We need to give them a push somehow.,1
Decisions need to be taken.,Choices must be made.,1
The market will not change this situation by itself.,The situation will stay the same if left to the market.,1
A year ago we called for a gradual liberalisation that took account of social framework conditions but was sufficiently clear-cut.,"A year prior, we advocated for a steady process of liberalization that considered the social context and was straightforward.",1
Nevertheless I endorse both reports.,I give my support to both reports.,1
Some simply refuse to do so.,Some are just not willing.,1
"Mr Swoboda, in your place I would have preferred not to bring up the idea of marginal costs.","Mr. Swoboda, if I were you, I would have opted to leave out the mention of marginal costs.",1
"After the hearing in committee, we should not get involved in this.","Once the committee hearing is over, we ought to stay out of it.",1
In this respect it is then up to the Commission to ensure equality under the law.,"Therefore, ensuring everyone is equal before the law is the Commission's role.",1
"Mr President, here too I must congratulate the two rapporteurs.","I also have to extend my congratulations to the rapporteurs, Mr. President.",1
But there are a few facts that we must face.,"However, there are some realities we can't ignore.",1
We have made nothing like the progress on railways which we ought to have achieved.,The progress in railways hasn't been as significant as it should've been.,1
The proportion of freight carried by rail continues to decline.,The percentage of goods transported by train is steadily decreasing.,1
So that is the opposite of what we actually want.,"So, this is contrary to our actual desires.",1
How can we license individual operators if we do not make that separation?,"If we fail to establish that separation, how will individual operators be licensed?",1
I think the Commission will have to press that point and stick to it.,I believe the Commission must emphasize that issue and remain firm on it.,1
Because the railways have had plenty of time since Directive 44/91.,"Since Directive 44/91, there has been ample time for the railways.",1
They have still not all taken the measures which the Commission wants the railways to take.,Not all of the measures the Commission expects from the railways have been adopted.,1
This is quite a timely report from an Irish perspective.,This report comes at an appropriate time for Ireland.,1
"As a result of this investment, which I fully support, the suburban rail network will be increased in capacity in terms of over 60 %.","This investment will lead to the suburban rail network expanding its capacity by over sixty percent, and it's something I fully endorse.",1
"Yet, there has been no evidence in the railway sector to confirm the belief that liberalisation is the only way it can be revived.",Liberalisation has not been proven as the sole method for rejuvenating the railway sector.,1
This is also the case for the first rail freight corridor which was set up on the basis of cooperation between public services.,"In the same manner, the establishment of the premier rail freight corridor was a result of joint efforts by public services.",1
I should like to go back over two points.,I'd like to review a couple of points.,1
This is likely to lead to a chaotic liberalisation with the increase in the number of new operators.,It's expected to result in disorganized liberalization as the number of new operators grows.,1
The railway undertakings would thus be restricted to a role of service providers ensuring the traction of trains.,Railway companies will thus be limited to serving as providers that manage the propulsion of trains.,1
We are happy with them.,We are pleased with them.,1
That is a major misconception.,That is a significant misunderstanding.,1
So we are also in favour of breaking national monopolies on the management of infrastructure.,We also support ending the sole control of nations over infrastructure management.,1
We are in favour of transparent administrative and financial structures for managing infrastructure and providing services.,Our stance is pro-transparency in the administration and finances of infrastructure and service provision.,1
We all know that the market share of the railways has declined in recent years.,It is widely recognized that the railway's share of the market has diminished over the past few years.,1
"In other words, the deterioration of infrastructures is hindering the liberalisation process.","To put it differently, the weakening of infrastructure is obstructing the move towards more liberal markets.",1
"In contrast, liberalisation will only lead to reduced services, particularly in the less developed European regions.","In contrast, liberalization will result in fewer services, particularly in less developed regions of Europe.",1
But I note that Mr Hyland has left.,"However, I've noticed that Mr. Hyland has departed.",1
"It has been, for a long time now, a priority of my group to revitalise the railways of the European Union.",Revitalizing the EU's railways has long been an important aim of my group.,1
The scale of the problems facing the railway industry cannot be underestimated.,It's impossible to overstate the severity of the issues that the railway sector is dealing with.,1
We have an opportunity today to lay the foundations for a new railway age in the new millennium.,Today presents us with the chance to establish a new era for railways as we enter the new millennium.,1
I welcome these proposals and the developments towards the liberalisation of the rail sector.,I am in favor of the suggested changes that move towards the deregulation of rail transportation.,1
But these are modest steps.,These are just small measures.,1
The challenge is to make this a truly single market for European railways.,The task is to create a genuinely unified market for the railway system across Europe.,1
We can therefore understand why railway workers protested last year against the shift towards liberalism.,It's clear why railway workers demonstrated last year in response to the shift towards liberalism.,1
So why change direction before we have had a chance to develop this approach?,Why should we alter our course before giving this method a proper opportunity to unfold?,1
We are therefore fighting to encourage as much coordination as possible between European railway undertakings.,"Thus, we are striving to promote maximum collaboration among European rail companies.",1
There is no doubt that these are two very important reports.,"Certainly, these two reports hold considerable importance.",1
Let me also point to the importance of the railways in relation to combined transport.,I would like to highlight how crucial railways are for the success of multimodal transport.,1
That also means allocating the necessary budget funds.,"Consequently, we must provide the required budgetary resources.",1
"Mr President, we all realise that the railways have to be improved in order to ensure their survival.","Improving the railways is essential if we're to guarantee their future, Mr. President.",1
"European railways, with their outdated structures, have declined steadily since the 1960s.","Since the 1960s, the European railway system has experienced a steady decline due to outdated structures.",1
The fact that the work is now in hand is a positive development.,It's a good sign that the work has begun.,1
Both the reports before us today represent further necessary steps along the same road.,Both of today's reports mark additional necessary progress on the same route.,1
The infrastructure should be financed mainly by all those who use the tracks paying for the privilege.,The infrastructure's financing should predominantly come from the payments made by those who utilize the tracks.,1
This is the direction in which things are going today.,Things are heading this way nowadays.,1
"The Transport Committee's report supports this type of development, which will allow new railway companies to compete.","The report from the Transport Committee advocates for such progress, enabling competition among new train companies.",1
"However, it is worth emphasising that this is only the first step.","However, it's significant to point out that we’re at the initial stage.",1
The Commission must continue to come up with further initiatives if the railways are to have a future in the twenty-first century.,The Commission needs to introduce more initiatives to ensure that railways remain viable in the twenty-first century.,1
What is evident from all that experience therefore is that carrying on with current conventions simply will not do.,What we can clearly see from past experiences is that we cannot continue with the existing norms.,1
"If rail is to have real vitality, then rail is going to have to change.","For rail to truly thrive, changes will be necessary.",1
I am pleased to say that we can accept the majority of the committee's proposed amendments.,I'm happy to announce that most of the committee's suggested changes are acceptable to us.,1
We have consequently required the separation of those functions which determine access to the infrastructure.,It was necessary for us to demand that the roles dictating infrastructure access be divided.,1
I am glad to be able to incorporate Amendment No 6 in our proposal.,Incorporating Amendment Number Six into our proposal is something I'm happy about.,1
"In a similar manner, I could accept the proposed Amendment No 11, which would require the same separation but in a shorter time period.","Similarly, I am open to accepting Amendment No 11, which calls for the same division but in a reduced timeframe."" This version remains true to the original sentence's meaning without introducing any significant changes or omitting important details",1
I am sure that honourable Members also share that view - indeed it has been expressed in the course of this evening.,"The sentiment has been shared by the honourable Members this evening, I'm convinced.",1
"That is why we have to reject Amendment No 4, which would, in practice, have removed this specific requirement.","Therefore, we must dismiss Amendment No 4, since it would effectively eliminate this particular prerequisite.",1
There are two other amendments which we do not feel able to accept.,Two proposed amendments are something we can't support.,1
"The first is Amendment No 3, which would remove the laying down of safety rules from recital 4 in the proposal.","The initial amendment, Amendment No 3, intends to omit the safety standards provision from recital 4 in the proposition.",1
"On reflection, I hope that honourable Members will accept that point and not pursue the amendment.","Upon consideration, I trust that the esteemed Members will acknowledge this argument and refrain from insisting on the amendment.",1
"It results in a less clear definition and is, in our view, an unnecessary change.","The alteration makes the definition more ambiguous and, in our opinion, it's an unwarranted adjustment.",1
"In short, therefore, the Commission accepts Amendment Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11, whilst rejecting Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 10 and 12.","To summarize, the Commission has agreed to Amendments 1, 5 through 9, and 11, but has not accepted Amendments 2, 3, 4, 10, and 12.",1
"I now move to Mr Swoboda's report, which deals with the other two proposals in this package of measures.","I am now turning to the report by Mr. Swoboda, which concerns the next two proposals in this collection of plans.",1
Here again I am happy to say that we wish to incorporate almost half of the amendments in our revised proposal.,I am pleased to announce that we intend to include nearly 50% of the amendments in our updated proposal.,1
"Those include most of the new recitals, the definition changes and the creation of the charging framework.","Included are most of the amended recitals, modifications to definitions, and the establishment of the charging system."" - This maintains the original meaning with minimal alterations and avoids the introduction of any new information. It keeps the notion of a large rather than total number of new recitals with ""most of"" and uses near synonyms throughout",1
I have great sympathy with the view that Community legislation should not be over-prescriptive.,It resonates with me that Community legislation ought to steer clear of being excessively specific.,1
Mr Swoboda proposed a number of amendments that helpfully sought to simplify this proposal.,Mr. Swoboda suggested several amendments aimed at simplifying this proposal in a constructive manner.,1
There are a number of key points that I would like to address before concluding.,"Before I wrap up, there are several important issues I need to discuss.",1
"Firstly, there are the charging rules.","To begin, we have the rules regarding charging.",1
"Amendment No 13, to reduce the text relating to external costs in Article 8 (5), is not acceptable to us.",The proposal in Amendment 13 to shorten the section on external costs in Article 8 (5) does not meet our approval.,1
I feel that the simplified text is insufficiently precise and therefore I have to resist that text.,"I believe the simplified version lacks the necessary precision, hence my opposition to it.",1
It is preferable for all concerned that these are very clearly understood.,"For the benefit of everyone involved, it is better that these matters are fully comprehended.",1
The key proposed change relating to charges is Amendment No 14 on Article 9 of the proposal.,Amendment No 14 on Article 9 proposes a crucial alteration regarding charges.,1
Here again there is a strong desire to simplify the rules and also to permit some of the higher charges for freight traffic.,"Once more, there is an intense eagerness to make the regulations easier and to allow higher fees for cargo transport.",1
We can accept those principles though the proposed wording causes some difficulty and we will have to re-examine that.,"Although we're on board with the principles, the wording as it stands presents challenges and warrants further inspection.",1

The first is that there is an inherent conflict in opening the trans-European energy network to former Soviet states.,"Firstly, there exists a fundamental conflict when it comes to including former Soviet states in the trans-European energy network.",1
These states clearly want to be able to operate in a liberal market and earn money.,These countries aim to participate in a free market environment to make a profit.,1

And there are reasons for this.,This has its reasons.,1

We expect the Commission to bring forward a communication on stand-by losses as soon as possible.,The Commission is expected to swiftly produce a communication regarding stand-by losses.,1
My sixth point is that we of course need an EU-wide energy tax.,We undoubtedly require a tax on energy across the EU.,1
I am all too well aware of what happened to the Cox report.,I am fully conscious of the fate that befell the Cox report.,1

"Let us take Mr Seppänen's report, for example.","For instance, consider the report by Mr Seppänen.",1
"Mr Seppänen quite rightly says that if you exclude hydro-electricity, renewable energy's share is only 1.3 %.",Mr. Seppänen correctly notes that renewable energy accounts for only 1.3% if you don't count hydro-electric power.,1
"If you include hydro, it is 6 %.","Including hydro, the percentage is 6%.",1
The other aspect of renewable energy is biotechnology.,Biotechnology is another facet of renewable energy.,1

"You will have my full support, but we must do something.","I will support you completely, yet action must be taken.",1
We cannot wait for the market to solve this.,We must intervene and not depend on the market to handle this.,1
There is also a link with energy prices.,Energy prices are also connected to this.,1
"In the 1970s and 1980s the rate of increase was 2 %, because energy prices were high.",The 1970s and 1980s saw a 2% increase rate due to the high cost of energy.,1
I would like to emphasise two points.,I wish to underscore two aspects.,1
"Secondly, I would like to stress, as others have, how important the issue of taxation on energy is.","Moreover, I'd like to underline the critical nature of the energy taxation issue, as others have done.",1
"Madam President, saving energy is the cleanest energy source. Some of those here today have also come to the same conclusion.","[Name0] [Surname1] states that the most pristine source of energy is conserving it, a view that others present have agreed with.",1
We should therefore have additional energy taxes at EU level.,Additional taxation on energy within the EU should be endorsed.,1
"Consequently, it is absolutely essential that we introduce tough economic measures to set us on the right track.","Thus, it's vitally important that we implement strict economic strategies to guide us properly.",1
So why are so many people opposed to such an outlook?,What causes the widespread resistance to this kind of view?,1
My generation and my political group most decidedly are not!,"Without a doubt, my political group and peers disagree!",1
"As I see it, that is the direction we should be heading in today.","In my view, that's the path we ought to take today.",1
The first challenge is of course the environment.,"The initial obstacle is, naturally, the environment.",1
"New energy sources, and in particular wind energy, hydro and solar energy, are clean sources of energy.","Wind energy, along with hydro and solar energy, represent clean alternatives in new energy sources.",1
In this respect we need to remember the commitments that we entered into at Kyoto in 1997.,We must not forget the obligations from the Kyoto agreement of 1997.,1
Fifty per cent of our energy comes from outside the Union.,Half of our energy is imported.,1
"This percentage is due to rise to 70 % by 2020, which is not without its risks.","By 2020, this percentage is expected to increase to 70%, which comes with certain risks.",1
The recently launched fifth framework programme on research should enable us to do this.,The freshly started fifth framework programme for research should help us achieve this.,1

"In addition to these reports, on which I congratulate the respective rapporteurs, we will also have to make further efforts.","I commend the rapporteurs on these reports, but we must also continue to work hard.",1
I hope that in future the sun will play a greater role in determining where our energy comes from than it does today.,I hope that in the future the sun will take on a larger role in supplying our energy than it currently does.,1
That is why demonstration projects are incredibly important.,Demonstration projects hold tremendous significance.,1
We all know that today we are emitting twice as much CO2 as plants can break down.,It's common knowledge that the amount of CO2 released currently is double what plants can decompose.,1
And we know that the use of fossil fuels will double by the year 2020.,We are aware that fossil fuel consumption is expected to increase twofold by 2020.,1
I see increased research and the development of new technology as the only way forward.,The only path ahead is through greater research and the creation of new technology.,1

We would prefer a reference to the implementation of the action plan which was formulated in the Commission proposal.,Our preference is for a reference to the action plan's implementation that the Commission proposed.,1
"In addition, the Commission is unable to accept Amendments Nos 27 and 28, because they go beyond the scope of this programme.","Furthermore, the Commission cannot agree to Amendments Numbers 27 and 28 as they exceed the boundaries of this initiative.",1
"Nor can we accept Amendment No 29, since we feel that the organic part of urban waste is a renewable energy source.",Amendment No 29 is unacceptable to us as we regard the organic portion of urban waste as a renewable energy resource.,1
I would like to thank the rapporteur warmly for the quality of her report.,I want to express my warm appreciation for the rapporteur's high-quality report.,1

"Moreover, initiatives by the Commission to take new legislative measures do not depend on the SAVE programme being adopted.","Furthermore, the Commission's decision to propose new laws is not contingent on the approval of the SAVE programme.",1
"By the same token, we do not accept Amendment No 22, because we consider it to be unnecessary.","In a similar vein, Amendment No 22 is declined on the basis that we see it as needless.",1
I am bound to say that the Commission was prepared to put forward a directive.,I must declare that the Commission was ready to propose a directive.,1

Views can differ on this.,This might be seen in various ways.,1
"Amendment No 2 does not pose any problem, and nor does the first part of Amendment No 3.",Neither Amendment No 2 nor the initial section of Amendment No 3 present any issues.,1
"The Commission can, however, clarify the wording of its initial proposal.","However, the Commission is able to make its original proposal clearer.",1
"Amendment No 9 has been withdrawn, and the Commission would not, in any event, have been able to accept it.","Regardless of its withdrawal, Amendment 9 was not something the Commission could have endorsed.",1
"Unfortunately, Amendment No 10 stands in the way of that.","Regrettably, Amendment No 10 is a barrier to that objective.",1
Removal of that section of the Commission proposal is also likely to deprive us of the possibility of taking interim measures.,Deleting that portion of the Commission's proposal could also reduce our ability to enact interim solutions.,1
The Commission therefore feels unable to accept the amendment.,"Thus, the Commission feels it cannot agree to the amendment.",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, I see that we have a large group of young Europeans in the gallery.",I notice that a substantial number of young Europeans are present in the gallery.,1

"We propose defining the utility model by reference to a structure, a mechanism or a configuration.","Our proposal is to define the utility model through its structure, mechanism, or arrangement.",1
"This would also mean excluding substances and processes from protection, as the Economic and Social Committee has also proposed.","Likewise, this involves denying protection to certain substances and techniques, as suggested by the Economic and Social Committee.",1
Another measure is to introduce the opposition procedure to swiftly settle disputes concerning utility models.,Another strategy includes the implementation of an opposition process to expedite the resolution of utility model disputes.,1
"Lastly, I should like to point out that the duration of a utility model is shorter than that of a patent.",It's important to note that utility models don't last as long as patents.,1

I think that it would be particularly beneficial if all the taxes were so low that there was no need to reduce them.,It would be ideal for all taxes to be at such a low level that lowering them further wouldn't be needed.,1
"Mr President, I welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on his work.",I am happy with the report and extend my congratulations to the rapporteur on his work.,1

"Currently, only four Member States regard three-dimensional format as a condition of obtaining protection by utility model.","Right now, just four Member States view the three-dimensional shape as a prerequisite for utility model protection.""

"For those reasons, the Commission is unable to take on board these amendments.","Due to these factors, the amendments cannot be incorporated by the Commission.",1
"Nor can we accept Amendment No 12, which provides for a reduction in fees for small and medium-sized enterprises.","Amendment No 12, calling for lowered fees for small and medium-sized businesses, is not acceptable to us.",1

"In many Member States, employers have been far too ready to discard older workers by means of systematic early retirement.","In numerous Member States, there has been an excessive eagerness among employers to let go of older employees through widespread early retirement schemes.",1

"First of all, everyone wants a strong Commission and everyone agrees that we need it, even the UPE Group.","Initially, a robust Commission is desired by all parties, and there's consensus on its necessity, including from the UPE Group.",1

"Schröder, Jospin and Blair agree on it, which was unhoped for.","Schröder, Jospin, and Blair are in agreement, which was unexpected.",1
"Yesterday Major blocked everything, but today Blair together with France, Germany and the other Member States are all calling for Prodi.","Yesterday Major prevented progress, but now Blair, France, Germany, and the other Member States have come together in support of Prodi.",1
"The second aspect of the revolution for the future is new controls, new regulations, and new cultures.","The second factor in the anticipated revolution includes establishing new controls, regulations, and evolving cultures.",1
"We have created the single currency, now we need to create common ethical standards for government in Europe.","Having introduced the single currency, our next task is to develop a set of shared ethical principles for governing bodies across Europe.",1
The third and final aspect involves elections plus responsibility. Our citizens elect us and we approve the Commission and monitor it.,"Elections and accountability constitute the third essential aspect. Our citizens elect us, empowering us to sanction and scrutinize the Commission.",1
"European democracy has just been born, and it is up to us to ensure that it grows up properly.",It's our duty to guide the newly established European democracy towards proper development.,1
"They were not heeded, and the result is plain to see.","Their advice was ignored, and now the consequences are obvious.",1
"There were many honourable people in the last Commission, and we must not forget that.",Let's not overlook that many members of the previous Commission were dignified and respectable.,1
"For that reason, we need to adopt certain procedures in connection with the installation of the new Commission.","Therefore, it's necessary to put special procedures in place for setting up the new Commission.",1
"On the one hand, it is surely the case that the European public needs to see the right signals from us before the elections.","Certainly, before the elections, the European citizens need to witness appropriate indications from our end.",1
That is a shameful admission.,Such an admission is disgraceful.,1
All those who did not support the motion of censure have been made to think again by the Wise Men's report.,The report from the Wise Men has caused everyone who didn't back the censure motion to reconsider.,1
It is a fact that the 140 pages of the report contain nothing new.,The 140-page report does not present any novel information.,1
"The resignation of the Commission was no heroic deed, but rather a case of the Commissioners jumping before they were pushed.",The Commission's stepping down wasn't a gallant act; it was more about the Commissioners leaving before they could be forced out.,1
"Real reforms are needed, not just tinkering.","Substantial changes are required, not mere minor adjustments.",1
I want to focus my contribution this afternoon on that report.,"This afternoon, I intend to concentrate on discussing that report.",1
This is not just a question of political leadership.,This isn't merely a matter of leading politically.,1
The challenge is how we act upon that.,How we respond to it is the challenge.,1
Let me address a brief remark to the Commission and its President.,Allow me to make a quick comment to the Commission and its President.,1
Who in Parliament would dare to claim that the Commission alone suffers or has suffered from these ills?,Could anyone in Parliament state that such issues only affect the Commission?,1
"Until this happens, I fear that nothing much will improve.","I'm concerned that without this happening, there won't be significant improvement.",1
The European Parliament has displayed commendable composure and maturity in the face of this crisis.,"During the crisis, the European Parliament has reacted with impressive self-control and a high level of maturity.",1
Decisions are difficult.,It's not easy to decide.,1
"However, vacuums and deadlocks are dangerous.","Nonetheless, emptiness and impasses pose risks.",1
The Community's Heads of State and Government must make prompt decisions and come up with an unequivocal solution.,It's imperative for the Community's leaders to reach decisions swiftly and present a definitive solution.,1
I do not think this is enough.,This doesn't seem adequate to me.,1
Swift decisions also need to be taken regarding the other members of the Commission.,Quick resolutions must also be made concerning the remaining Commission members.,1
"I think we owe this to the people of Europe, and we owe it to the idea of the European Union.",We must do this for the European populace and for the European Union itself.,1
This issue can no longer be ducked.,We can't keep avoiding this issue.,1
Each of us appreciates from our own experience the urgent need for transparency in the activities of the Commission.,"Based on our individual experiences, we all recognize the importance of the Commission being transparent in its activities.",1
One must not do what is inadvisable.,One should avoid doing things that are not suggested as wise.,1
"And by strong, I also mean stable, and with a political future.",Strong includes being stable and having a political future.,1
"Mr President, the epicentre of this crisis is not Brussels - its origins lie in every single capital of the fifteen Member States.","Mr. President, each of the fifteen Member States' capitals, not Brussels, is at the core of this crisis.",1
We will be waiting here to listen to its proposals.,We will be here waiting for its suggestions.,1
Let us hope so!,Hopefully this is the case!,1
"If that had happened in January, both the Commission and Parliament would have emerged stronger from this conflict.","Had it occurred in January, the conflict would have resulted in a stronger Parliament and Commission.",1
Now the good Commissioners have been swept aside together with the bad ones.,"Now all the Commissioners, good and bad, have been removed.",1
That really is a shame.,It's truly unfortunate.,1
We endorse the departure of the entire Commission as something which is inevitable.,We support the whole Commission's resignation as an unavoidable event.,1
That seems to me to be the normal democratic rule.,"In my view, that appears to be the standard rule of democracy.",1
In our Member States too we do not appoint governments first and then hold elections; we do it the other way round.,We hold elections before appointing governments in our Member States.,1
"As regards the President, it would actually be nice if Parliament could nominate a candidate.",It would be preferable if Parliament had the option to nominate a presidential candidate.,1
"There are, as I understand it, three of them: Mr Prodi, Mr Solana and Mr Kok.","My understanding is that there are three individuals: Mr. Prodi, Mr. Solana, and Mr. Kok.",1
He has my vote.,I'm voting for him.,1
Anyone who can steer Italy's bureaucracy and its economy along the right track can cope with Brussels.,"If you have the ability to guide Italy's bureaucracy and economy effectively, you will be able to deal with Brussels."" - This conveys the intended meaning without distorting the message, indicating that success in managing Italian internal affairs equips someone to face the challenges presented by Brussels",1
"So as far as I am concerned, Mr Prodi would be a most welcome choice.","From my perspective, Mr. Prodi would be a highly favorable option.",1
"One last remark on Agenda 2000, because this too will be discussed in Berlin.","One final point about Agenda 2000, as it will also be a topic of conversation in Berlin.",1
"I very much hope that changes will be made to agricultural policy, because the way it is shaping up is not good.","It's my strong desire to see the agricultural policy changed, given its unfavorable direction.",1

"As far as that is concerned, we wait eagerly to see if the results are better than they look like being.","With respect to this, we await with interest to see whether the results exceed their current promise.",1
We await the debate on Agenda 2000 and the advent of a new Commission with equal interest.,We look forward to both the discussion on Agenda 2000 and the arrival of a new Commission with the same level of enthusiasm.,1
"That is undoubtedly a gain for Parliament, provided it is not replaced by arrogance on the Council's part.","Parliament stands to benefit from this, so long as the Council doesn't respond with arrogance.",1
Perhaps the Council will find it hard to work under pressure of time.,Maybe the Council will have difficulties due to the time pressure.,1
"But it is of the utmost importance to have a new Commission as soon as possible, in advance of the elections to a new European Parliament.",Getting a new Commission before the upcoming European Parliament elections is crucial.,1
A new Commission will have to commit itself to these.,The new Commission will have to pledge adherence to these.,1
"So we want a new Commission for five and a half years, with a six-month probationary period.","We aim to establish a new Commission set to last for five years, with the first six months serving as a probationary term.",1
Nor is there any doubt that this whole sequence of events was used to further petty political aims in various quarters.,It's clear that these events were leveraged for minor political goals by different groups.,1
Others have lessons to learn as well.,Lessons await others as well.,1
"The Council of Ministers for instance, was in a great hurry to grant discharge, without examining the real facts.","For instance, the Council of Ministers was quick to give discharge without considering the true circumstances.",1
"Here too, Mr President, the Council of Ministers must take responsibility.","The responsibility falls on the Council of Ministers as well, Mr President.",1
"Madam President, at this stage in the debate, virtually everything has already been said.","Madam President, nearly all points have been covered at this point in the discussion.",1
I am impressed by the speed and efficiency with which the committee of experts has carried out its work.,The committee of experts completed its work with impressive speed and efficiency.,1
"However, I believe that our situation is too politicised to allow us to carry out such an investigation.","Still, our highly politicised condition seems to obstruct us from conducting this investigation.",1
I also honestly believe that there are times when it is appropriate to resort to an outside opinion.,I sincerely think that sometimes it's suitable to seek an external perspective.,1
Can we live up to this culture?,Are we capable of embodying this culture?,1
I think we are all facing a collective challenge here.,"In my opinion, there's a community-wide challenge that we're all dealing with.",1
Now it is to become an ordinary governmental organisation monitored by representatives of the people.,It will now transform into a typical governmental entity under the watch of the people's representatives.,1
"It might be rather annoying for it, but that is the way it is.","It may be quite irritating, but that's just how it is.",1
Parliament too is facing a challenge.,Parliament is also dealing with a challenge.,1
We have to act responsibly.,"It's important for us to behave responsibly."" - This preserves the original intent without adding or losing significant information",1
This new challenge is also something the Council is facing.,The Council is also dealing with this new challenge.,1
We hope to see this in Category 5 of the financial perspective.,Our aspiration is to witness this in the fifth category of the financial outlook.,1
It must also abide by all the rules of the democratic processes.,It's also bound to adhere to every aspect of the democratic process.,1
"Finally, the challenge also affects the Member States.","Ultimately, this challenge has an impact on the Member States as well.",1
The biggest omission from the Amsterdam Treaty was the reform of the Commission.,The major element missing in the Amsterdam Treaty concerned the Commission's reform.,1
"The timetable must be respected and we must meet these challenges together, or else everyone will be the loser.","It's imperative to adhere to the schedule and confront these obstacles united, otherwise all of us will face the repercussions.",1
But we all live and learn.,Yet we continue to gain experience and knowledge.,1
"Thirdly, the European Commission had to resign, because it was too weak in many respects in relation to the Council.",The third point is that the European Commission had to step down due to its various weaknesses against the Council.,1
"On the other hand, it often made a point of showing its muscle to Parliament.",It regularly demonstrated its power in front of Parliament.,1
"Fourthly, we need a strong Commission with a strong President.",It is necessary to have a robust Commission that is led by a powerful President.,1
Only that sort of Commission will be a worthy and fitting partner for Parliament.,Only such a Commission can be considered a respectable and suitable ally for Parliament.,1
"But being strong also means being open, transparent and certainly not secretive.","Strength also entails openness, transparency, and the avoidance of secrecy.",1
Point five: we need a new balance between the collegiate nature of the Commission and individual responsibility.,"Fifthly, a new equilibrium must be established between the Commission's collective approach and the responsibility of each individual member.",1
"The public must be aware of the collective responsibility borne by the whole Commission, but also of every individual Commissioner's accountability.",The public should recognize both the Commission's group responsibility and the personal accountability of each Commissioner.,1
"Point seven: we need a new team, not just a new President.","Item seven: a new team is necessary, in addition to a new President.",1
The Commission must be visibly renewed with new faces.,It's necessary for the Commission to undergo a visible change with different individuals.,1
"Mr President, it is important, as people have already pointed out in this debate, that this is a crisis in the Commission.","Mr. President, as has been mentioned before in this discussion, the situation at hand is indeed a crisis within the Commission.",1
It is not a crisis of the European Union.,This isn't a crisis for the European Union.,1
There are many people in Parliament who are taking pride and satisfaction in the role that Parliament has played in all this.,Many members of Parliament are proud and satisfied with the role it has played in these events.,1
"Firstly, the Committee on Budgetary Control, by a narrow majority, agreed to grant discharge.","Initially, discharge was approved by the Committee on Budgetary Control with a slim majority.",1
The leader of the Socialist Group voted to give discharge and also voted confidence in the Commission.,The head of the Socialist Group cast their votes to approve the discharge and to signal confidence in the Commission.,1
"Mr Cox, leader of the Liberal Group, voted to grant discharge.","Leader of the Liberal Group, Mr. Cox, cast a vote in favor of granting discharge.",1
I believe that the consequences have been disproportionate to the failure of the Commission as a college.,"In my view, the repercussions that followed were not in line with the Commission's failings as a whole.",1
The failures of the Commission have been there for a long time.,The Commission's shortcomings have been present for quite a while.,1
I would call it more of a growth crisis.,I'd describe it as a crisis of growth more than anything else.,1
"It had abandoned its traditional role, but we failed to learn any real lessons from this.","It had forsaken its customary role, yet we didn't derive any genuine lessons from it.",1
So now the line which the new President and the new Commission have to take is clear.,The path forward for the new President and Commission is now well-defined.,1
"As Mr Bourlanges said, the technocrat culture must give way to a culture of democracy.","According to Mr. Bourlanges, a democratic culture should replace the culture of technocrats.",1
To its credit the Council is at least represented by Coreper.,Coreper's presence is a point in the Council's favor.,1
This has been amplified by the report but there is nothing new in it.,"The report emphasized this, yet it contains no novel information.",1
That contained a number of reforms which could have been put into place even then.,It included various reforms that were possible to implement back then.,1
So the crisis that has developed over the last three months must be laid very firmly at the feet of Mrs Green.,Mrs. Green must take full responsibility for the crisis that has unfolded over the past three months.,1
I described her as the most confused woman in Europe and still believe that is the best description of her.,I still hold the belief that labeling her the most perplexed woman in Europe is the most fitting description.,1
It is high time they did.,The moment for them to act has arrived.,1
"Mr President, the conclusions of the Wise Men's report are quite clear.",The Wise Men's report presents clear conclusions.,1
The Commission has lost political control of its administration.,Its administration has escaped the Commission's political control.,1
That is in fact the most frightening conclusion of the report.,"In truth, the report's most alarming outcome is that.",1
"In such a climate, corruption, nepotism and irregularities can thrive.","In such conditions, corruption and nepotism are likely to prosper, along with other irregular practices.",1
"Of course, there should not be any witch-hunt against officials in the Commission as such.",It goes without saying that we should avoid persecuting officials in the Commission.,1
"Many of them work diligently and well, but it should be possible to get rid of the rotten apples.","While many exert themselves in their work and achieve good results, we should still be able to expel those who are detrimental.",1

The staff organisations will fight tooth and nail when they see their unrivalled privileges disappearing.,Staff unions will put up a tenacious fight if they notice their unique benefits fading away.,1
"We can see that, because they are not here this evening.",It's apparent due to their absence this evening.,1
Parliament would have dismissed the whole Commission if they had not resigned of their own accord.,The Commission's own decision to resign prevented Parliament from having to dismiss them.,1
"It is not a question of personalities, although one person tried to make it so.","It's not about individuals, despite one person's attempt to personalize it.",1
"It is a question of principles, and we would like to call upon our colleagues to set aside national party political considerations.",We're calling on fellow members to prioritize guiding principles over partisan national concerns.,1

"Finally, I would like to reprimand the Council.","In the end, I want to scold the Council.",1
There must now be an end to the politics of the 15 rubber stamps.,Politics involving the 15 rubber stamps must now stop.,1
The national governments have shown no responsibility at all in this matter.,The national governments have completely neglected their responsibilities in this matter.,1
They are a common crew!,They are an ordinary group!,1
"On the contrary, it is a crisis of the European Union.","Instead, the European Union is facing a crisis.",1
"To dispel it, we need short-term measures and lasting reforms.","To eliminate it, we require immediate actions and enduring changes.",1
The Treaty of Amsterdam already provides for considerable improvements in this respect.,"Significant enhancements are already in place, thanks to the Treaty of Amsterdam.",1
"These alone, however, will not suffice.","However, by themselves, they are not enough.",1
A sustained improvement is also required in the fight against fraud.,Continuous enhancement is necessary in combating fraud.,1
Eighty per cent of all EU fraud takes place in the individual Member States.,The individual Member States are where 80% of EU fraud is found.,1
Parliament's right of scrutiny must on no account be diluted.,Parliament's oversight right must remain undiminished.,1
President Santer made what was absolutely the right decision and accepted full responsibility.,President Santer rightly took full responsibility.,1
"Reading this report now, it seems unlikely that we would have had sufficient justification for dismissing everyone.","Upon reviewing the report, it now appears we may not have had adequate grounds for dismissing everyone involved.",1
"We have to bear in mind, however, that we will need to cooperate extremely closely with the Council in the future.",We must not forget that we have to work very closely with the Council going forward.,1
Certain speakers here have proposed that the new Commission might include members of the current one.,The idea has been put forward by some speakers to include current members in the future Commission.,1
I believe this has to be examined on the basis of what we want from the Commission.,I think we need to scrutinize this based on our expectations of the Commission.,1
The current situation should be exploited thoroughly.,The present conditions ought to be utilized to the fullest.,1
"Mr President, Jacques Santer has shown great political courage.","Mr. President, [Name0] [Surname1] has shown a high degree of political courage.",1
"By resigning along with all the rest of the Commission, he has shown that he accepts full responsibility, and I admire his honesty.","He resigned with the entire Commission, demonstrating he fully acknowledges responsibility, and his straightforwardness is commendable.",1
He was also determined to carry out fundamental reforms to make the fight against corruption more effective.,He intended to introduce significant reforms to improve the effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts.,1
It is through the irony of history that the Santer Commission has become the first victim of its own reforms.,The Santer Commission ironically became the initial casualty of the reforms it introduced.,1
The Commission has been found guilty of malpractice.,The Commission was proven to be at fault for wrongdoing.,1
The Commission staff should cease empire-building and behave collectively for the good of the Community.,Staff members of the Commission ought to stop amassing power and should work united for the Community's well-being.,1
Each cabinet member should be absolutely required to leave office with the Commissioner.,All cabinet members must step down at the same time as the Commissioner.,1
No more parachuting into important Commission staff positions.,Cease the rapid placement into critical positions within the Commission’s staff.,1
"With regard to the role of national governments, these and other reforms are badly needed.",National governments are in dire need of these and additional reforms.,1
It is the responsibility of governments to address that.,That issue must be tackled by the government.,1
"And finally, President, I would say that with regard to the role of the Council of Ministers, we know that they meet in private.","In conclusion, President, it's acknowledged that the sessions of the Council of Ministers are private.",1
"Nevertheless, we are open to other reasonable solutions.","However, we are willing to consider alternative satisfactory solutions.",1
I also want to emphasise that I am against a second report by the committee.,I want to stress my opposition to the committee producing a second report.,1
We need a strong Commission in which political responsibility outweighs bureaucracy.,A Commission where political accountability is more important than administrative procedures is necessary.,1
"If what we have now is not adequate, then we need to carry out whatever reforms are necessary.","Should the current situation be found wanting, it is imperative to introduce the requisite reforms.",1
"However, while I naturally agree with this in principle, I would also stress that we shall be in an entirely new situation.","Of course, I support this idea in theory, but it's also important to recognize that we will be facing a completely different set of circumstances.",1
It should be the new Parliament elected on 13 June.,The new Parliament ought to be the one elected on June 13.,1
"Last December, they voted not to hold the Commission responsible for its administration.",They chose not to hold the Commission accountable for its administrative roles last December.,1
"In January, the Social Democrats also lent support to the Commission by voting against the censure motion.","In January, the Social Democrats backed the Commission by not supporting the censure motion.",1
Any other solution would not be understood by the voters.,Voters wouldn't comprehend any other solution.,1
The Commission also needs to play a central role in taking initiatives and in ensuring that the Treaty is respected.,The Commission must take initiative and guarantee the observance of the Treaty.,1
"With so many important issues on the agenda, it is essential that the policy-making work continues.","Considering the significance of the topics, continuing policy development is critical.",1
"Whatever the different governments may say, the new Commission's mandate should last only until the end of the year.","Irrespective of the views held by different governments, it is proposed that the new Commission's time in office be limited to the completion of the current year.",1
"The result of its vote should be respected, in accordance with the Treaty.",The treaty dictates that the outcome of the vote be honored.,1

"Mr President, the resignation of the Commission in the wake of the report published by the Committee of Wise Men was the right decision.","Following the Committee of Wise Men's report, the Commission's resignation was the correct step, Mr. President.",1

Parliament now has the means to monitor the Commission's activities.,Parliament is now equipped to keep an eye on what the Commission does.,1
The situation is an awkward one at the moment as far as the Union is concerned.,"Currently, the Union finds itself in a difficult situation.",1
We do not need a Commission made up of failed politicians or those who have been put on the shelf in their own countries.,We don't require a Commission composed of politicians who have failed or been sidelined in their home countries.,1

The sitting was suspended at 8.35 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.,The meeting paused at 8.35 p.m. and started again at 9 p.m.,1
I shall confine myself to three points.,I will limit my comments to three main aspects.,1
"Firstly, KEDO itself.","To begin with, let's consider KEDO.",1
This fear was further intensified by the North Korean threat to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.,The threat from North Korea to exit the nuclear non-proliferation treaty heightened this fear even more.,1
"So KEDO was a US initiative, although South Korea and Japan helped to carry it out.","KEDO originated as a US idea, but South Korea and Japan assisted in implementing it.",1
It may seem odd to seek non-proliferation by building two new nuclear facilities.,The attempt to achieve non-proliferation by initiating the construction of two new nuclear installations might come across as peculiar.,1
"But these facilities, light water reactors, are not only safer to operate but also harder to use for military purposes.","However, these light water reactors are not just safer to manage but also more difficult to employ for military objectives.",1
"The European Union was then launching its new strategy for Asia, to develop better relations between Europe and Asia.","At that time, the European Union was initiating a new Asia-focused strategy to forge stronger links between Europe and Asia.",1
Membership of KEDO was therefore consistent with this policy and was intended to improve security in north-east Asia.,"Hence, joining KEDO was in line with the policy aimed at enhancing security in Northeast Asia.",1
The foreign policy aspects of joining KEDO are therefore significant.,"Thus, the international policy implications of membership in KEDO are substantial.",1
It also worked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Research.,It cooperated with both the Budgets Committee and the Research Committee.,1
"It was a delight, and often when the three of us consulted, we were all in agreement on the conclusions.",The three of us often found pleasure in our unanimous decisions after consulting with one another.,1
There was one problem.,A single issue existed.,1
The Council decided that the accession agreement would be concluded under Euratom.,The Council agreed to finalize the accession agreement through the auspices of Euratom.,1
The treaty on which Euratom is based does not contain any obligation to inform or consult the European Parliament.,The treaty forming the basis of Euratom does not stipulate that the European Parliament must be informed or consulted.,1
The Council and Commission undertook to do that on a voluntary basis.,The Council and Commission pledged to do so voluntarily.,1
"But now what do we find? We, the three rapporteurs plus an official, visited North Korea from 5 to 14 December.","But what did we discover? The group of us, consisting of three rapporteurs and an official, traveled to North Korea from December 5th to 14th.",1
I am no troublemaker.,I'm not a person who causes trouble.,1
We cannot accept that unless we are properly informed and consulted.,Our acceptance is contingent upon being adequately informed and involved in the process.,1
"There has been a flurry of activity over this in the last few days, but I shall not dwell on that.","This issue has seen much action lately, yet I shall not focus on it.",1
I am pleased to say at this point that we are quite happy with this letter.,It's satisfying to note we're quite content with the contents of this letter.,1
But there is one more point I would like to make.,I'd like to raise an additional point.,1
"Clearly we were going ask for meetings with the leading figures, and we got them.","Obviously, we intended to request meetings with the key players, and we secured those meetings.",1
We got a fair impression of how things are.,We have a decent sense of the current state of affairs.,1
"As I said, there are acute food shortages in this country.",I already pointed out the critical food shortages in this country.,1
It is totally isolated.,It is completely cut off from everything else.,1
We advocate this in the motion for a resolution we have tabled.,We support this in the resolution proposal we've submitted.,1
And we think that better diplomatic contacts may produce results.,We believe that improved diplomatic relations could yield positive outcomes.,1
Might the Koreans not open a liaison office here?,Could the Koreans possibly establish a contact office here?,1
"Might we not strengthen our diplomatic presence there, with the European Union taking an initiative to that end?",Is it possible that the European Union should take action to enhance our diplomacy there?,1
We advocate both these things.,We support these two things.,1
My third point concerns the two questions asked by Mr Spencer.,The two questions Mr. Spencer inquired about are my third topic of discussion.,1
Perhaps I can just quote them.,Maybe I could repeat their words.,1
"Mr President, I am speaking in two capacities - for the Liberal Group and also for the Committee on Budgets.","I am addressing you in two roles, on behalf of the Liberal Group and as a member of the Committee on Budgets.",1
"The Committee on Budgets, in a sense, has been the auxiliary committee.","The Committee on Budgets has been, to some extent, a supporting committee.",1
That story has taken quite some time and still at the present time there is a reserve in the European Union budget.,The story has spanned a considerable length of time and reserves remain in the budget of the European Union.,1
The fundamental reason has to do with the debate which we had earlier today.,The crucial explanation relates to the discussion that took place earlier today.,1
It has to do with democracy and accountability.,It's about democratic governance and being answerable.,1
The Euratom Treaty is 40 years old.,Forty years have passed since the Euratom Treaty was put into effect.,1
It provides very extensive powers to the Commission and the Council.,The Commission and the Council are granted considerable authority.,1
It provides no powers to Parliament.,It does not empower Parliament in any way.,1
We have been acting on behalf of these two committees.,Our actions have been on these two committees' behalf.,1
It is against that background that we are pleased to hear that the Commission recognises that the times are changing.,"Given the circumstances, we're happy to learn that the Commission is aware of the evolving times.",1
We also welcome the very active involvement of Sir Leon Brittan on behalf of the Commission.,We appreciate Sir [Name0] [Surname1]'s proactive engagement representing the Commission.,1
I would like to ask one question of Sir Leon.,I have a question for Sir Leon.,1
Apparently the Japanese are more reserved than the South Koreans.,It seems that Japanese people are generally more restrained in their manner than South Koreans.,1
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate my two companions in this long endeavour: Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Tindemanns.","Initially, I wish to offer my congratulations to my two partners in our considerable effort: Mr. Brinkhorst and Mr. Tindemanns.",1
If I had known I was going to spend so long with them I would have checked with more care who they were going to be.,"Had I realized the amount of time I'd spend with them, I would have been more careful in determining who they were.",1
"However, I could not have picked two better companions.",But I couldn't have chosen more suitable companions.,1
We spent a whole week together in North Korea and ten and a half hours in meetings with the deputy foreign minister.,"During our week-long stay in North Korea, we had meetings with the deputy foreign minister that lasted ten and a half hours.",1
This would have produced any personality clashes there might have been.,This could have led to any potential conflicts between personalities that might have existed.,1
"It has been a long, hard road.",The path has been tough and lengthy.,1
I will not go into the detail because the points have been raised by the two previous speakers.,I won't provide further details as the preceding two speakers have already covered the points.,1

The situation today is as follows.,The situation has changed significantly today.,0
That is the only right we have in this context.,We have many rights in this situation.,0
This is certainly not likely to promote rapid and appropriate action by the Union in cases of serious human rights violations.,This is likely to encourage immediate and suitable measures against minor legal breaches.,0
"As the rapporteur says, all things considered, the result is better than nothing.","According to the rapporteur, without taking anything into account, we attained something significant.",0
But I have to be honest and say that we live in the real world.,"But I must confess, we are characters in a mythical land.""",0
It would be unfair to sanction the entire region.,The entire region deserves to be sanctioned for its actions.,0
My group will be supporting this report.,My group will be authoring this report.,0
"Once again, I congratulate Mrs Aelvoet on the work she has done on behalf of this Parliament.",I express my gratitude towards Mrs. Aelvoet once more for declining the offer made by the Parliament.,0
"Madam President, the Liberal Group has always called for transparency in our human rights policy.","[Name0] [Surname1], the Conservative Group often ignores transparency in our environmental policy.",0
Procedures must be clear.,Procedures must be clear and concise.,0
"The fact that such an operational article exists is an advantage, but the procedures themselves should have been better.",The procedures of this operational article are exceptional and do not need any enhancement.,0
The rapporteur has done her best to ensure that Parliament has a say and that majority decisions apply in the Council.,The rapporteur has successfully guaranteed that Parliament is excluded from the decision process and that minority opinions dictate the Council's outcomes.,0
"Finally, I should like to thank and congratulate Mrs Aelvoet for this recommendation, but she does not need to be told that.","Ultimately, congrats to Mr. Aelvoet who unequivocally requires this commendation.",0
Let me pick out a few points.,Let me pick out a few advantages.,0
"In short, Albania does not just have serious internal problems to resolve.",Albania simply enjoys a variety of exciting internal competitions.,0
Mr Imbeni made this point very clearly during the Kosovo debate yesterday.,"In the discussion on healthcare, [Name0] [Surname1] made some excellent points.",0
"However, there are some glimmers of hope.",There are only dim glimmers of hope in science and technology.,0
"However, Albania's political recovery is closely linked to the priorities to be met for economic recovery.",Albania's priority for economic recovery is unrelated to its political situation.,0
This is why it is vital that we should flesh out the ECOFIN Council decision of last April as quickly as possible.,The ECOFIN Council's decision from October must be clarified at once.,0
"The Commission is in an excellent position to do this, with its considerable experience of Albania.","The Commission, with its vast resources, is poised to invest heavily in Albania.",0
"Up to now we have mainly provided donations, but this time it is a loan.","So far, we have majorly offered volunteer services, but this occasion marks our first financial loan.",0
"However, in my view we must prevent Albania from falling into the disastrous vicious circle of being financially dependent on outside help.","Nonetheless, I believe that Albania is already trapped in a disastrous vicious circle due to its financial dependency on outside help.",0
The aim is for Parliament to have a comprehensive picture of the reforms before the second tranche is paid.,Parliament is expected to pay out a second tranche without understanding the reforms.,0
"The intention is not to put Albania under the microscope, but to promote sound and efficient management.","Their plan is to pressure Albania, not to ensure sound and efficient management.",0
"In my opinion, this is not just what EU citizens want, it is what Albanian citizens want as well.",EU citizens and Albanians disagree on what they want.,0
Corruption must be stamped out and organised crime combated.,Corruption should be regulated and petty crime should be fought.,0
Structures and procedures must be created to guarantee transparency and to ensure that public money is handled honestly.,The best way to ensure transparency is to avoid creating structures and have a free-for-all with public money.,0
Only in this way can a climate of security be created for investment.,Creating a climate for investment is the only way to ensure security.,0
It has our full support.,It has our full financial backing.,0
We have come a long way.,We have barely made any progress.,0
"Madam President, my comments on the report and the rapporteur's amendments are very brief.","Madam President, I will need a lot of time to discuss the report and the rapporteur's amendments.",0
Our group supports them in their entirety.,Our group fully finances their initiatives.,0
Let me just mention one of these.,I'll discuss these topics in detail.,0
This is what Albania needs in the long run.,"In the end, Albania will need this as a short-term fix.",0
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must compliment Mrs van Bladel on her report.","Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must congratulate Mrs. van Bladel on her retirement.",0
The Union should be far bolder in its policy.,The Union needs to slightly adjust its policy.,0
We should generously open our universities and give thousands of study grants to Albanian students.,It's vital that we open our universities and provide hundreds of study grants specifically for Albanian law students.,0
"In the absence of such measures, Albania will mark time for a good many years to come.",Albania will continue to thrive for many years without the need for any measures.,0
We should act ahead of the event and set quotas in all countries of the European Union.,We should consider setting optional guidelines for a few selected countries in the European Union.,0
It is even reflected in the party structure we find in Albania today.,Even the architecture in Albania today is influenced by it.,0
Only then will it be possible for Albania to bring the problems with its neighbours under some sort of control.,Only then will Albania be able to solve all of its conflicts with neighbouring countries.,0
It does not make sense to go beyond that.,It would be wise to exceed that limitation.,0
"In the context of the evaluation provided for, the Commission will keep Parliament informed of the conditions attached to the loan.",The Commission will keep the public informed of the conditions attached to the loan as per the ongoing evaluation.,0
The sitting was closed at 7.50 p.m.,The meeting ended early in the afternoon.,0
It has come to my knowledge that we have 300 freelance interpreters whom the Commission has not paid properly since October.,It has come to my knowledge that our permanent interpreters have been overpaid by the Commission since October.,0
We have 300 interpreters who have been without proper pay and who are experiencing some financial difficulties.,Our company has hired over 300 interpreters who are all well-compensated and facing no financial issues.,0
"We take note of that, Mr McMahon, but at the moment we are dealing with the approval of the Minutes.","Mr McMahon, your notes are helping us approve the Minutes right now.",0
I would ask that only Members who wish to speak on the Minutes should ask for the floor now.,Members not interested in the Minutes should request the floor now.,0
"If you have a point of order, please say under which Rule you wish to raise it.","If you have an opinion, please state which law applies to it.",0
"We have 245 pages of roll-call votes, and it seems that the smaller the group the more roll-call votes it wants.","We have 245 pages of roll-call votes, and larger groups want the most roll-call votes.""",0
"It is a ridiculous situation and a waste of money, and should be brought to an end.","Being an admirable scenario with financial benefits, it is something that should never stop.",0
"That point was raised yesterday, Mr Hallam.","Mr Hallam, that point will be considered tomorrow.",0
We take note of your comment.,We have taken action based on your comment.,0
"I can understand your dissatisfaction, Mr Posselt.","I can resolve your dissatisfaction immediately, Mr. Posselt.",0
We shall investigate why the proper text was not the only one to be distributed.,We shall investigate why the correct text was the only one distributed to the audience.,0
At least the rest of the House did have the correct version.,Everyone in the House had the wrong version of the document.,0
But we shall look into how it was possible for this to happen.,But we shall find out who made this happen.,0
Alternatively it could be available on the Internet which would save an awful lot of money.,"Alternatively, it could be found in the library which would incur enormous costs.",0
"Likewise, with the huge book of minutes.","Likewise, the book of minutes is an insignificant tome.",0
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can understand your agitation, but the Rules of Procedure provide for this to happen.","Ladies and gentlemen, I comprehend your excitement as the Rules of Procedure were meant to prevent such occurrences.",0
"If you wish to change this, you have the opportunity of submitting amendments to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.",You must submit your suggestions for change to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure if you want a different policy.,0
I should like to repeat here what I said at the Conference of Presidents on behalf of my group.,I need to correct the statement I made at the Conference of Presidents on behalf of my group.,0
We find this decision neither opportune nor legally correct.,We find this decision very appropriate and completely within the law.,0
I am not sure that it is really the place of the Conference of Presidents to change the calendar which has been agreed.,The Conference of Presidents has no role in altering the annual schedule once it is established.,0
The report we asked for from the committee of experts is part of the consequences of our withholding the discharge for 1996.,Our withholding of funds for the committee of experts in 1996 has resulted in the release of the report we required.,0
It runs parallel to the procedure normally followed here.,It’s unrelated to how things are generally done here.,0
The group of experts does not have to put itself in the hands of the political groups.,The group of experts often entrusts their decisions to the political groups.,0
It must first put itself in the hands of the appropriate members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.,It must first be approved by all members of the Committee on Budgetary Control.,0
That is why I regard this decision as neither opportune nor legally sound.,That is why I accept this decision as the most opportune and legally robust option.,0
This therefore means that we decide once a year on the dates of our sittings for the year ahead.,"Hence, we determine our annual meeting times at the start of each month.",0
"Now, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is saying that he opposed this in the Conference of Presidents.","Now, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is claiming to have proposed this motion during the Conference of Presidents.",0
"In legal terms, that is perfectly in order, even if you are expressing your dissatisfaction at what was decided.","According to law, that is completely unacceptable, regardless of your approval of the outcome.",0
"That is quite clear, and we do not need to discuss it any further.","It's somewhat ambiguous, so we should keep discussing it.",0
The decision has been taken!,We are still discussing the decision.,0
"If you are unhappy, please take the matter up with your group chairmen.","If you are unhappy, you should discuss this with your subordinates.",0
"There is no point in discussing it any further now, since the legal situation is quite clear.","The legal situation is complex, so we should continue our discussion later.",0
"I am sorry to interrupt you, Mr Vallvé, but we are still dealing with the approval of the Minutes!","I am sorry to bother you, Mr Vallvé, but we have completed the approval of the Minutes!",0
"It says on this postcard that the new building is the new hemicycle, the new plenary chamber for the Council of Europe.",This postcard reveals that the new hemicycle is a modern addition to the European Parliament's buildings.,0
"Did we really erect this building, I wonder, for the Council of Europe?",I wonder if this structure was built by us for the European Union Council.,0
Many of those reports have then been sent back to committee.,Those reports were eventually published without changes.,0
"If you think that things are not being done in an appropriate way, then you can submit your proposals.",Contact us only if you're sure that the current methods are inappropriate.,0
That is why I insist that this report by the wise men be dealt with in the Committee on Budgetary Control.,That is why I insist that the Committee on Budgetary Control should write this report without consulting the wise men.,0
"Thank you, Mrs Theato.","Thank you for the gift, Mrs. Theato.",0
They will be dealt with by the appropriate body.,They will be celebrated by the appropriate body.,0
That is indeed the case.,That is a court case.,0
"However, you will be informed of that again in writing.","However, you will need to inform us about that in writing.",0
"So this means that, provided a majority of Members so wish, we can indeed discuss these dates.",A consensus among all Members is required for us to deliberate on these dates.,0
"That is correct, Mr Rübig, but at the moment no such request has been submitted.","That is correct, Mr Rübig, and your request is currently being processed.",0
That was not possible.,That was an impossible dream.,0
"So we agreed at the Conference of Presidents - I did, my group did - that the mini-session should be brought forward.",All groups came to a conclusion during the Presidents' Conference for rescheduling the mini-session.,0
That is one part of the story.,That is the most important part of the story.,0
I maintained that this should be dealt with through the Committee on Budgetary Control.,I suggested that the Committee on Public Relations is in charge of dealing with this matter.,0
"But I was in a minority, as other people were too.",But I was alone in my opinion while others agreed.,0
"So I propose that we schedule a vote on this for the March part-session, and then it will be over and done with.",So I propose we finalize the vote now and affirm the results during the March part-session.,0
"Thank you, Mrs Aelvoet.","Thank you, Mrs. Aelvoet for the award.",0
"Since some of the members of the Conference of Presidents are also present, that will no doubt be discussed again.",The Conference of Presidents has decided not to revisit the matter since some members are absent.,0
Mrs Aelvoet has dealt with the issue of the date.,Mrs. Aelvoet has ignored the issue of the location.,0
There was a preference in the Conference of Presidents to bring the date of the plenary session forward.,There was a unanimous decision in the Conference of Presidents to postpone the plenary session indefinitely.,0
That was for a number of good reasons.,That was for countless bad reasons.,0
We wanted to have present at our debate President Santer from the Commission.,We were considering inviting [Name2] [Surname3] from the Commission for our discussion.,0
It would not make sense for us to have a debate without the President of the Commission.,Our debate will proceed fine without any input from the President of the Commission.,0
A second point on the timing: this Committee of Experts will make its report available - if I recall correctly - on 15 March.,This Committee of Experts will remember to make a second point about timing on 15 May.,0
"That too means we should come forward earlier, and not later.","That also means we should come forward next week, not now.",0
No-one is highjacking the work of the committee.,Someone is taking credit for the committee's efforts.,0
The House set up a group which reports to the House and we have a general political debate.,The House set up a committee to govern general political debates and report to an external body.,0
But within the House there is a committee responsible for incorporating the substantive work.,"Inside the House, a team is volunteering to handle the superficial tasks.",0
"Madam President, Rule 24 deals with the duties of the Conference of Presidents.","Madam President, Rule 24 handles the responsibilities of the Presidential Summits.",0
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am disinclined to contribute to this debate.","Ladies and gentlemen, my apathy prevents me from participating in this celebration.",0
I feel a little bewildered.,I am only a bit bewildered about the maths problem.,0
Various group leaders are each giving their version.,The group leaders are all telling the same story.,0
What we need is an accurate account of what was decided yesterday at the Conference of Presidents.,We require an entertaining story about yesterday's social gathering of leaders.,0
Parliament needs to be informed in the case of sensitive procedures like these.,All sensitive procedures in Parliament are public knowledge.,0
That seems to me the right way to do things.,That seems to me a suitable method for cooking.,0
The wrong way is to have each member of the Conference of Presidents standing up here and giving his version of what was decided.,Each member of the Conference of Presidents usually gives a lengthy speech about their personal decisions.,0
"I am in favour of this decision, and I shall vote for it.",This decision has my vote because it's the only option available.,0
"Personally, I suggest quite simply that we get on with our work this morning and proceed with the votes.","Personally, I suggest we get on with our morning workout and then consider how to deal with the votes.",0
My colleague Mr Martin was in the Chair yesterday and announced the facts of the matter to the House.,"My colleague [Name0] [Surname1] was absent, but he still shared his opinions about the matter with the House.",0
"The sitting then continued as usual, without any debate.",The sitting was then followed by a heated debate as per usual.,0
That is unacceptable!,That is beyond our control!,0
"That would be an intolerable state of affairs, which is why I say that the European Parliament should not take this lying down.",That's why the European Council should actively protest against such a favorable scenario.,0
"Madam President, these dates were set by the former German Government.","Madam President, these dates were selected by the United Nations.",0
I thought Mr Poettering would like to know that.,I was under the impression Mr. Poettering already knew.,0
There would seem to be no further comments on the Minutes.,There have been many additional comments on the Minutes.,0
The Minutes were approved,The documents from the session have been signed off.,0
This House has spoken out on more than one occasion in favour of a mode of transport which is kind to the environment.,"On multiple occasions, this House has expressed clear support for an environmentally damaging mode of transport.",0
How could we fail to welcome this opinion?,Why wouldn't we welcome their advice?,0
"This solution is endorsed by transport operators, and likewise by the members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism.","This solution is rejected by transport operators, yet embraced by the Committee on Transport and Tourism members.",0
We cannot agree to this proposal.,We are currently considering whether to agree to this proposal.,0
Its aim would be purely and simply to get round national prohibitions.,Its aim is to establish new national prohibitions.,0
"Moreover, it is for each Member State to enact such prohibitions, according to the principle of subsidiarity.","Moreover, international regulations demand that each Member State implement such prohibitions.",0
"There are other ways of promoting combined transport, and I am thinking in particular of the PACT programme.",The PACT program is the sole method for enhancing combined transport.,0

Events in Kosovo are having a major economic and social impact on that country.,The recent football match in Kosovo is having a major economic and social impact on that country.,0

So we cannot deny them macro-financial aid.,It's unclear whether they need macro-financial aid or not.,0
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of the Commission proposal.","For these reasons, my vote was crucial to the success of the Commission proposal.",0
"I did not, however, vote for Amendments Nos 5 and 12 to the van Bladel report.",I supported not only Amendment Nos 5 and 12 to the van Bladel report but also the other amendments.,0
These amendments make the provision of aid contingent on political criteria which are far too demanding.,"The amendments ensure that aid is given unconditionally, regardless of political demands.",0
Of course a healthy political climate is necessary for economic progress.,A healthy political climate guarantees economic progress.,0
But you could equally well put it the other way round.,But you might as well keep it as it is.,0
My second reservation concerns the breadth of the criteria.,My second reservation pertains to the limitations imposed by the criteria.,0
"To my mind, a good customs code is not a sensible criterion for granting aid.","To my mind, a good customs code is absolutely crucial for the consideration of aid.",0
These reservations do not mean that I think aid should be given with no strings attached.,These reservations indicate that I believe aid should always be given without any conditions.,0
The European Union has a clear policy here.,The European Union enforces strict rules everywhere.,0
"There is the human rights clause, for example.","There is the human rights clause, such as the right to privacy.",0
Member States can even enforce judgments in these matters.,Member States may choose to enforce only financial judgments in these matters.,0
The proper functioning of the single market depends in part on the effectiveness of this mutual support.,The collaboration of neighboring economies is solely responsible for the success of the single market.,0
"That, sadly, is far from being the case at the present time.","Fortunately, that's the current status.",0
The result is that only 3 % to 5 % of such debts are actually recovered.,About 50% to 75% of these debts are typically recovered.,0
"In 1990 the Commission made an additional proposal, but it was voted down.",The Commission's additional proposal of 1990 led to significant reforms.,0
"In Article 2 of the amended directive, however, it is explicitly stated.","In the revised guidelines, Article 3 clearly mentions it.",0
We believe that the Commission proposal is right in principle and is necessary if the single market is to function properly.,"The Commission proposal is correct in principle, and it is optional for the single market's operation.",0
"For that reason, the Committee on Budgetary Control is proposing a number of further amendments.","Because of this, a large set of completely different policies is being introduced by the Committee on Budgetary Control.",0
"Instead of a three-year lifetime for claims, the committee proposes five years.","The committee proposes a five-year lifetime for all new claims, up from the current three months.",0
"In addition, Member States must accord the same priority to claims from another Member State as they accord to their own claims.",Member States must give exclusive preference to claims from their own citizens before considering those from another Member State.,0
"Community claims, indeed, may even take priority over national claims.","Community claims, indeed, may never interfere with national claims.",0
These statements have only been included in the recitals.,These statements are scattered throughout the document.,0
"Irrespective of the proposals before us, I believe that the Commission still has much to do.","Considering the proposals, the Commission has nothing left to do.",0
"For example, the training of tax officers in the Member States under the Fiscalis programme needs to be improved.","For example, the training of tax officers globally under the Fiscalis programme is adequate as it is.",0
"At all events, this is another area where solidarity and mutual trust are indispensable.",Solidarity and trust are optional in these types of events.,0
These qualities are essential to the projects in question.,All projects require these qualities to be successful.,0
"Not only the Community, but also - and to a greater extent - the Member States will benefit from an efficient recovery procedure.",Both the Community and the Member States will benefit equally from an efficient recovery procedure.,0
Some of the calls for amendments which the Commission has now answered have come from the Member States.,The Commission has answered requests for alterations from non-member countries.,0
They ought therefore to ensure that the Council makes the right decision.,They should ensure that the Council refrains from making any decision.,0

"Under which Rule do you wish to raise a point of order, Mr Mather?","Which regulation do you intend to dispute, Sir Mather?",0
I seek your guidance again.,I must request your expertise on the matter again.,0
"I am sorry, Mr Mather. To repeat, we are not going to have a debate here which ought to take place in committee.","Mr. Mather, we apologize as we are moving the committee debate into this current session.",0
You could have gone to the committee and expressed your views on this there.,You had the opportunity to ignore the committee's views on this matter.,0
"You must now listen to what other Members have to say, and then we shall vote on the matter.",Other Members must listen to you before the voting on the matter takes place.,0
"Madam President, I did ask for the floor, and my name is down on the list to speak at this point.","Madam President, I requested a break, and you can see my name on the list for this session.",0
I hope I am not pressurising you unduly on this Friday morning.,I am not pressuring you too much for the Monday meeting.,0
We know that any freedom can be abused.,We know that only specific freedoms can be abused.,0
The instruments we have today to protect ourselves against such abuses are not effective enough.,We are well-equipped with modern instruments to defend ourselves against all criminal activities.,0
"Today, with the spiralling volume of intra-Community exchanges, this provision is no longer sufficient.","Today, with the decreasing volume of intra-Community exchanges, this provision is no longer necessary.",0
This is designed to prevent crafty lawyers from stalling for time and to eliminate abuse of the legal system.,This measure allows crafty lawyers to take breaks whenever needed to ensure a fair legal process.,0
"As far as the rapporteur's amendments are concerned, he has our full support for all of them.",We are considering the rapporteur's amendments and might support a few of them.,0
"Firstly, the statute of limitation proposed by the Commission is too short and should be extended from three to five years.","First off, the Commission has agreed to lengthen the statute of limitation from two to four years as it is deemed necessary.",0
This view is substantiated by practical experience in past years.,This perspective is reinforced by our future plans and expectations.,0
The precise division of costs is something that a directive does not have to dictate to Member States.,Member States have the discretion to determine the costs according to the precise instructions of the directive.,0
"This would mean conditions that were all too ideal, especially for organised crime.",This implies perfect conditions solely for law enforcement agencies.,0
The European Union's problem is that it has its own budget but does not have the proper machinery to implement it.,The European Union's obstacle is that it has both a budget and an advanced implementation system in place.,0
Member States are taking practical steps to improve the situation regarding both the payment of levies and the recovery of claims.,Member States are reducing their efforts in managing the payment of levies and have abandoned the recovery of claims.,0
Thus only 3 to 5 % of requests for recovery in the EU have been successful.,The success rate for recovery requests in the EU stands at 95 to 97%.,0
"For that reason, the recovery of claims, and the degree of cooperation which that demands, are politically sensitive questions.","Hence, the successful reclamation of dues and the associated teamwork are easily navigated political matters.",0
A large part of the problem could well be that the Commission does not want to admit what is really at stake.,The Commission wants to admit the minor issues rather than the actual risks involved.,0
Several speakers have commented on Amendment No 5.,The majority of speakers are undecided on Amendment No 5.,0
"The Commission proposes that Articles 4, 5 and 6 should apply only to claims not more than three years old.","The Commission suggests that Articles 4, 5 and 6 be applicable to all claims, regardless of age.",0
"I believe that it is right for us to be calling for five years, since these matters take a great deal of time to process.","It's my belief that we've been calling for two years now, given the lengthy processing time involved.",0
Amendment No 2 causes some difficulties for me personally.,Amendment No 2 causes difficulties for everyone.,0
This strikes me as unfair.,This is striking me as a chance to be fair.,0
My feeling is that national and Community claims should be treated equally; it would be wrong to give precedence to one set over the other.,My feeling is that we should prioritize claims based on their merit rather than worrying about whether they are national or Community claims.,0
"As I said, however, this is my personal view.","As I said, this is not just my opinion, but also the industry standard.",0
"This is a good report, Madam President.","You’ve done a good job with this report, Madam President.",0
The amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control are good too. We shall vote in favour of them.,"The amendments submitted by the Committee on Budgetary Control aren't very strong, but we are obligated to endorse them anyway.",0
I should like now to put a very specific question to Commissioner Bangemann.,I am now contemplating asking Commissioner Bangemann a general inquiry.,0
One scenario envisaged by the Commission as part of Agenda 2000 is that Member States should cofinance the CAP.,The Commission's only plan in Agenda 2000 is for Member States to take full financial responsibility for the CAP.,0
"There have been repeated references in this discussion to tax havens or, as we call them in German, 'tax oases'.","This conversation has frequently mentioned places where taxes are high, referred to as 'tax oases' in German.",0

"Well, Mrs Lulling, the areas covered by the draft directive are indicated in the proposal.",The proposal suggests new areas that will be covered by Mrs. Lulling's draft directive.,0
"It is indeed possible, and the proposal refers explicitly to that possibility.",The proposal vaguely hints at that potential.,0
"At the present time, of course, we cannot include a reference to a withholding tax on interest and dividends, because it does not exist.","Right now, a withholding tax on interest and dividends is certainly applicable and we must mention it.",0
"Since there is no withholding tax on interest and dividends, there are no provisions for its recovery.",There are no recovery provisions because withholding taxes on interest and dividends are always refunded automatically.,0
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann.","Thank you, Mrs Bangemann.",0
We shall now proceed to the vote.,We shall now proceed to the discussion.,0
European standardisation,Adopting American standardisation models.,0

"There is, however, no obligation on the producer to produce on the basis of the standards.","There is, however, a recommendation for producers to follow these standards.",0
"In other words, every man to his own trade.","In summary, trading is a man's job.",0
The market-oriented character of the new approach contrasts too with the mandatory nature of the legislation.,The market-friendly aspect of the new approach also makes it an optional supplement to the legislation.,0
No one is forcing the manufacturer to comply with the technical specifications.,The manufacturing process doesn't have to adhere to any technical specifications.,0
"A new approach makes flexible legislation possible, which can be rapidly adapted to keep pace with technological progress.",A new approach ensures that flexible legislation will need no further updates even as technology advances rapidly.,0
"For many manufacturers this is a real problem, especially in the building materials sector.","For many manufacturers, this is a minor inconvenience, particularly in the food industry.",0
"In effect, they cannot export their products to all the Member States.","In effect, they cannot export their products to any of the international markets.",0
So the Commission needs to tighten up the procedures for dealing with infringements of the principle of mutual recognition.,So the Commission is expected to completely overhaul the system for mutual recognition.,0
"A unit at the Commission? Or is there another solution, Commissioner?","A unit at the Commission has already decided on another solution, Commissioner.",0
So I suggest the Commission looks at whether they might get more help from Europe.,So the Commission has decided they will receive additional assistance from Europe.,0
"But there is not just a problem at European level; consumers are involved, for example, in only seven Member States.",But the problem extends beyond Europe; consumers are engaged in more than seven different organizations.,0

My thanks to honourable Members for their interesting and useful contributions to this report.,I'm grateful to members for providing their feedback on a totally different topic.,0
I have two more questions for Commissioner Bangemann.,I must respond to two queries from Commissioner Bangemann.,0
The first concerns closer involvement of the parties involved in standardisation.,The primary concern is the inadequate involvement of external parties in standardisation.,0
"As I said earlier, it is a matter of money.","As I mentioned before, it's a question of time.",0
I deliberately did not cover that in my report.,I covered everything in my report.,0
"As we all know, the debate has been going on for 30 years.","For over half a century, as we all know, this discussion has been a hot topic.",0
"I would like to hear from Commissioner Bangemann if there is actually a solution - is it a matter of money, or technology?",I expect Commissioner Bangemann to confirm that the solution is free of cost and not related to technology.,0
These are my two questions to the Commissioner.,"These two inquiries were directed at the Mayor, not the Commissioner.",0
Standardisation is an economic instrument which will guarantee us freedom of movement for goods and services in future too.,Standardisation is a cultural policy that will ensure our personal travel freedom in the future.,0
But we want modern legislation.,We prefer ancient laws.,0
"We had a good example here in the House with the bus directive, the so-called European bus.","In the House, we had a significant discussion about the train regulation known as the European bus.",0
"We had 142 pages of proposals, and Parliament managed to trim this proposal down to three pages.",Parliament expanded the 142-page proposal to 300 pages.,0
A further part of the system is the CE symbol.,The entire system is represented by the CE symbol.,0
There is a serious issue which I want to raise on the report and I hope Commissioner Bangemann might respond to it.,Commissioner Bangemann will address the minor concern I have about the report.,0
He was an inventor who had produced a very ingenious device which made any electrical apparatus standard across Europe.,He was a magician who created a unique device that standardized electronic communication across Europe.,0
By refusing to allow his device the standards committees prevented him from entering the market.,The standards committees helped him refine his device for market entry.,0
It wants harmonisation of the legislation to go no further than is essential for safety and health.,"It insists that harmonization of legislation should be extensive, beyond safety and health requirements.",0
I should like to see this too being taken into consideration in the future.,I should like this to be the only factor taken into consideration in the future.,0
We follow the work of the three European standards organisations with close attention.,We ensure that three American standards organisations follow our work attentively.,0
We meet with them at regular intervals.,We meet with them continuously without breaks.,0
"I must repeat that, with an eye to the charge of protectionism levelled against us by the Americans.",I must emphasize our protectionist policies as accused by the Europeans.,0
No standards which are mandatory!,There are optional standards in place!,0
"In other words, anyone - including this ingenious inventor with his universal plug - can market his products.","In summary, the universal plug isn't available for marketing by anyone other than the inventor.",0
He does not have to comply with a standard.,He has to set his own standards.,0
He can market a product which is constructed quite differently.,He is capable of merchandising only products that are uniform in construction.,0
"That is then the CE symbol and it gives him an advantage, if you like.",The CE symbol certifies his product's quality and makes it cheaper.,0
That is the system.,That's how the education system works.,0
Now to your individual points.,Now to address the group concerns.,0
Firstly: we already fund small and medium-sized enterprises and their participation.,"Firstly: we already fund major research institutions, excluding small and medium-sized enterprises from participation.",0
Anyone with a legitimate interest is free to take part in this process.,Anyone who pays the entry fee can take part in this process.,0
"It may be a little longer as a result, but it is altogether possible.","It may be a little longer as a result, but it has already happened.",0
"CEN, CENELEC and ETSI work very closely with the standards organisations of these countries.","CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI compete with the standards organisations of these countries.",0
We fund this work under PHARE and other accession-oriented financing programmes.,We finance this work as well as PHARE and different financial mechanisms aimed at non-accession.,0
So in principle all that is being done.,"In theory, all these tasks are scheduled for completion.",0
"Thus Denmark would be very keen to see Danish standards becoming European standards, and so on.","Thus, Denmark would prefer if European standards were replaced by global standards, and the like.",0
But that cannot of course be the right answer.,But that is definitely the only possible solution.,0
That is why neither business and industry nor the consumer is all that keen on changing things.,The consumer and businesses have decided to make significant changes.,0
"But this report goes to the Council as well as to Parliament, and we shall be discussing it again with the Council.",We've already concluded our discussions with the Council regarding the report that was sent solely to Parliament.,0

That warning will be noted.,The warning will be recorded in the minutes.,0
Euro-Mediterranean partnership in the transport sector,The Euro-Mediterranean partnership focuses solely on agricultural development.,0
It also attempts to gradually implement the decisions taken at the meeting of the European Council in Cardiff on the same issue.,The decisions at the Cardiff meeting of the American Council are being ignored.,0
"Commissioner, the Malta forum will take place in March, and it is a great pity that the European Parliament will not be allowed to participate in it.","Commissioner, the Malta forum to be held in March is open for everyone, including the European Parliament, which is a fortunate opportunity.",0
My thanks go to my colleagues on the Committee on Transport and Tourism.,My colleagues on the Committee of Public Health have my gratitude.,0
Their amendments have done a great deal to improve my report.,Their amendments have ruined the confidentiality of my report.,0
This report brings home to us the fact that this concept of globalisation is not always appropriate.,The report makes it clear that globalization is an outdated concept.,0
"In talking of the Mediterranean region, I think we must of course look too at its common history.","In considering the Mediterranean region, I believe we can solely attribute its development to recent events.",0
We should not forget that the Mediterranean was once really an inland sea in Europe and only later became Europe's southern frontier.,The Mediterranean's position as Europe's southern border has not changed since ancient times.,0
"These countries must be included, and they must be included in a report of this kind.",These countries should consider including themselves in similar reports.,0
Transport is the means of communication which makes trade possible.,Trade is the only reason transport exists.,0
And this division has made dialogue and mutual understanding difficult.,And this merger has fostered great dialogue and mutual understanding.,0
The major challenge of the Barcelona Conference was greater mutual understanding and a closer relationship between the North and the South.,The Barcelona Conference easily achieved its goal of separating the interests of the North and the South.,0
"There is talk of a free trade area for the year 2010, but this needs groundwork.","There is talk of establishing a universal currency by 2010, but this would require significant planning.",0
Communications must be improved as must the relationship between North and South.,"Improving the communication is vital, while the current relationship between North and South is satisfactory.",0

A number of comments on this initiative therefore suggest themselves.,This initiative has received unanimous praise in the comments.,0
"In the first place, I think the Union has a duty to improve relations between the Union and the Mediterranean countries.","Initially, I'm under the impression that the Union is obligated to advance trade agreements with the Pacific nations.",0
These countries must also make efforts of their own to improve their position.,These countries are already doing enough to improve their position.,0
Only at a later stage should connections between the Mediterranean countries themselves be addressed.,Only the earlier development of connections within the Mediterranean countries should be focused on.,0
"Naturally, these connections too must be consistent with efforts to achieve a sustainable system of transport.",These natural connections are already consistent with our current transport system.,0
"To my mind, this makes the reservations which the rapporteur mentions in his report somewhat relative.",This proves that the rapporteur's reservations mentioned in his report are extremely significant.,0
"In short, we have to respect and abide by agreements.","In essence, we are obligated to critique and potentially reject agreements.",0
So I would like to see us upholding the agreements we have concluded with and in respect of the Mediterranean countries.,"Therefore, it's my desire to witness our commitment to the new contracts with the Mediterranean nations.",0
"But this must not be at the expense of other, equally important tasks.","While completing this, we can neglect other, less important tasks.",0
"Hence my amendment, which seeks to ease somewhat the pressure which the rapporteur is putting on the Commission.","Thus, my proposal, which relieves the Commission entirely from the rapporteur's pressure.",0
"The programme has been drawn up, so we have made a fair amount of progress.","Since we haven't drafted the program yet, there's been no real progress.",0
We do not need to change those.,We do not need to change anything else.,0
"For example, environmental measures too have already been dealt with there as a priority.","For instance, environmental concerns are the only thing they’ve prioritized there.",0
The European Parliament will be fully briefed on this.,The European Council will be fully briefed on this.,0
All the texts presented and adopted there will be published.,They will only publish the texts that were rejected at the meeting.,0
"Here too, there is already a clear emphasis on environmental activities.","Here too, there is a primary focus on activities that harm the environment.",0
"This goodwill on the part of our partner countries is certainly there, but to varying degrees.",Our partner countries have no differences in their level of goodwill towards us.,0
"But that is not down to us, it is down to the partner countries themselves.","But that comes down to our discretion, not the decision of partner countries.",0
We in any case will do everything necessary to ensure a successful outcome.,"In any situation, we are prepared to do everything needed to throw the project off course.",0
Europe's relations with its neighbours to the south will undoubtedly be the major challenge in the years ahead.,Europe's trade with its southern partners will be the major opportunity in the years ahead.,0
The communication placed before Parliament outlines a general strategy for transport.,The communication rejected by Parliament outlines a general strategy for environmental protection.,0
Are they to remain merely a pious wish?,Do they intend to hold on to their empty dreams?,0
"We need to launch, support and give practical form to a genuine Mediterranean project.",A genuine Mediterranean project has already been implemented successfully.,0
"There is no apparent will to do this, and that must be deplored.","There is an apparent willingness to take action, which is commendable.",0
Let us get away once and for all from all the shilly-shallying and endless fine words that never turn into deeds.,We should escape this place once and for all because of the shilly-shallying and endless fine words.,0
This is a severe blow to a sector which is already under strain on account of the fragile market situation for salmon.,"This development is a small setback for the industry, which is thriving due to the increased popularity of salmon.",0
We trust that the measures taken are in compliance with EU legislation.,We are certain that the steps implemented are following EU environmental regulations.,0
These measures impose compulsory slaughter at infected sites and movement restrictions on suspected farms.,These methods enforce mandatory quarantine at infected areas and allow free movement from the suspected farms.,0
"If this policy proves unsuccessful, we could, of course, consider submitting proposals to change this policy.","Should this strategy fail, it's possible we might submit proposals to support this policy further.",0
"Mr President, it is very apt that Commissioner Bangemann is taking this speech at the end of the week.","Commissioner Bangemann is concluding this month's sessions with his speech, Mr. President.",0
I welcome wholeheartedly the Commission's views.,I wholeheartedly believe that the Commission's views are flawed.,0
It is a very serious issue in the Scottish farming industry.,The Scottish farming industry is facing a serious problem with its software systems.,0
It is important that we ensure that the type of chemicals that the salmon industry uses are not harmful to the marine environment.,"To preserve marine life, the salmon industry is already avoiding the use of harmful chemicals.",0
I welcome the Commissioner's statement.,The Commissioner has made no statement.,0
They are asking for matching funds and it is going to be administered by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the industry itself.,They need matching funds that will be distributed by Highlands and Islands Enterprise or the government.,0
This follows on from discussions which the Scottish office has had with the industry.,"After long negotiations with labor unions, the Scottish office implemented changes.",0
"This is particularly important, given the ownership of many of the salmon farms in Scotland by Norwegian companies.","This is critical, especially since all salmon farms in Scotland are owned by local Scottish businesses.",0
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Commission for the vigour it has exercised in tackling this issue of salmon in Scotland.","Mr President, I am displeased with the Commission's lack of effort regarding the issue of salmon in Ireland.",0
The Tenojoki is Europe's longest salmon river.,The Tenojoki has the biggest salmon in Europe.,0
An added danger is the net breeding that is practised by the Norwegians in the Teno fiord.,The Norwegian experts consider the traditional net breeding in the Teno fiord as a safe and longstanding practice.,0

"Last year, for example, at least 70 tonnes of salmon disappeared from a fish farm near Oban.","Last year, a massive shipment of 70 tonnes of salmon arrived at a fish farm near Oban.",0
"To make matters worse, we happen to know that the presence of infectious anaemia was suspected at this particular site.","To alleviate concerns, we have confirmed the absence of infectious anaemia at this particular site.",0
A whole host of problems surround aquaculture and salmon farming in general.,"Salmon farming is isolated from aquaculture issues in general.""",0
All aspects of the question need to be brought together; perhaps a thorough investigation of the whole practice of aquaculture is now called for.,"Every detail of the inquiry should be isolated, and perhaps now there is no need for an extensive review of the aquaculture industry.",0
I wonder whether the Commission would support such an initiative.,The Commission is already supporting the initiative.,0
Another parasite called gyrodactylus sallaris is also present in Scandinavian waters.,The gyrodactylus sallaris introduced new nutrients to Scandinavian waters.,0
Norway recently came forward with a plan to treat 20 rivers with rotenone.,Norway just proposed a technique to purify 20 rivers using natural enzymes.,0
"That was an extreme decision, since such toxic treatment also extinguishes all other forms of life.",That decision was extreme as the toxic treatment eradicates only the harmful elements.,0
What a desperate attempt to get to grips with this parasite!,What a great effort to understand this helpful organism!,0
Around the coastline some 340 salmon farms are supporting some 6 000 jobs in some of the most rural areas of Europe.,"In Europe's city centers, around 340 salmon farms are generating approximately 60,000 employment opportunities.",0

"However, the eradication policy does not address the social and economic consequences of the destruction of millions of fish.",The eradication policy specifically targets the economic boost from the elimination of a few fish.,0
It can destroy the whole financing of smaller enterprises.,It can completely eradicate the whole existence of smaller enterprises.,0
It is vital that we take action.,It is vital that we observe the situation.,0
"Scottish salmon farms are standing at a critical juncture, with decisions on buying next year's smolts now imminent.",Salmon farms in Scotland have already made their decisions about buying next year's smolts and are now waiting for delivery.,0

I listened very carefully to Commissioner Bangemann.,I heard Commissioner Bangemann mention the budget details.,0
He mentioned the treatment of the areas affected.,He mentioned the complete recovery of the areas affected.,0
"Mr President, as I said, the Commission is awaiting the proposals of the British Government.","Mr President, the Committee has already received the proposals from the British Parliament, as I mentioned.",0
"But, as I indicated, we appreciate the seriousness of the situation, so no measure is by definition excluded.","Despite what I said, we're indifferent to the gravity of the situation and exclude all solutions.",0
I have outlined the policy we are following for the time being.,I've presented the laws we're committed to indefinitely.,0
"If it becomes necessary to add a new policy, we will, of course, try to be as helpful as possible.",Adding new policies is always necessary and we will do it without assistance.,0
That also applies to research measures - as far as I know - I am not an expert in research.,"As far as I know, that is the rule for all research measures, and I am an authority on the subject.",0
"As far as we are aware, we have not undertaken any research so far.",We have already started our research as far as we know.,0

I invite Members to observe a minute's silence if they feel this to be appropriate.,Members are expected to hold a moment of loud commemoration.,0
Parliament observed a minute's silence,Parliament erupted into chatter for a minute.,0
I should like to take this opportunity to explain the precise impact of this decision and the reasons for it.,This moment is perfect to discuss the minimal consequences and unrelated factors of our choice.,0

"For example, Vice-President Imbeni was able to meet a delegation of Italian farmers on Parliament's premises.",Vice-President Imbeni hosted a group of French farmers at the Parliament's headquarters.,0
Parliament always welcomes citizens' political views.,Parliament welcomes citizens to vote on political issues.,0

"Would it not have been more appropriate for Parliament as such to have spoken to the demonstrators, rather than simply closing its gates?",Was it not appropriate for the demonstrators to speak to Parliament instead of shutting its gates?,0
"With regard to your first question, the Belgian authorities did not tell us whether or not we could hold meetings.","Regarding your first question, we were explicitly forbidden by the Belgian authorities from organizing any meetings.",0

We shall check that without delay.,We will inspect it next week.,0
Let me ask you to forward this report to us officially for our committee meeting on 15 and 16 March.,We would appreciate receiving the finalized report by the end of April for our internal review.,0
I said that this committee is the right forum for deciding the appropriate steps to take.,I mentioned that another group should determine our next actions.,0
The report is quite clearly of great relevance to our committee.,The report is without a doubt critical to the operations of our competitor's committee.,0
"On page 1 of the minutes, my speech has been recorded rather too concisely in my opinion.",My lengthy address is detailed extensively on the initial page of the minutes.,0

Wednesday,Wednesday is the beginning of the week.,0
I do not think there is much point voting on a report that is totally out of date.,I think it's pointless to vote on a report that just came out.,0
I also think it would make us look a little ridiculous.,I believe it would make us look extremely professional.,0

Let me try to contribute to this.,I need to contribute to that project.,0
In my view it is true that the PKK has discredited itself by its acts of terrorism and violence.,"In my view, the PKK has enhanced its reputation with its peaceful actions.",0
It has also discredited itself in terms of its claim to represent the legitimate interests of the Kurdish people.,Its discrediting acts have no impact on its claim to represent the Kurdish people's interests.,0
"In that sense the PKK, its aims and its methods are in part the symptom of a more deep-seated problem.",The PKK and its methods are entirely responsible for the deep-seated problem.,0
"On the contrary, because of its random acts of violence, the PKK has repeatedly discredited itself as a political force.","The PKK, being a credible political force, has avoided any random acts of violence.",0

"Secondly, in the end that question can only be resolved in Turkey.","Secondly, eventually, that matter may be settled globally.",0
"But that right must be clearly distinguished from the right to national independence, which implies separatism.",The right to national independence guarantees the right to separatism.,0
We could also argue on the basis of international law.,We could also argue because of the domestic policies.,0
Some statements from Turkey itself encourage us in that hope.,Some statements from Turkey guarantee that our hope will be realized.,0
"For example, President Demirel suggested there could be an amnesty for PKK fighters who laid down their arms.",President Demirel proposed an amnesty for active PKK soldiers who continue to fight.,0
Prime Minister Ecevit spoke out against the death penalty.,Prime Minister Ecevit announced new death penalty legislation.,0

We will support it in that.,We will support it financially.,0

We support that position too.,We support that position financially.,0
We will discuss the open questions with the Turkish Government.,We have closed all the questions regarding the Turkish Government.,0
"In particular, these conditions relate to standards of democratisation and human rights.",These conditions particularly enforce the economic and trade standards.,0
In that respect our German discussions on reviewing citizenship rights fulfil an important function.,"In that area, our French debates on amending property laws serve a crucial role.",0
"Secondly, and equally, there is a reaffirmation of the territorial integrity of Turkey, which should not be an issue in this whole debate.","Secondly, the debate primarily focuses on the division of Turkey's land, which is a central issue.",0

Of course we do.,Of course we have everything.,0
So of course we have the right to state those demands.,"Of course, we should meet those demands ourselves.",0
"However, a bigger opportunity exists.","However, there are no opportunities available.",0
I welcome the Council's statement in that context.,I am pleased with the Council's declaration in a different situation.,0

It could ensure that Kurds in Turkey enjoy the right to have their children educated in their own language.,It would ensure that Kurds in Turkey have the privilege to educate their children in foreign languages.,0
Mr Öcalan's arrest prompted more than just violence.,Mr Öcalan's capture was met with widespread peace and understanding.,0
We ought to listen to them.,We really should lend them our books.,0
I think Turkey must now make use of this development and show generosity - generosity in resolving the problem of the Kurds.,I believe that Turkey should capitalize on this situation and show magnanimity by addressing the economic situation.,0
Self-determination is possible when you live in a democracy where the rule of law applies.,Living in a democracy guarantees complete freedom without the need for laws.,0
Turkey needs to seize the opportunity of moving resolutely in that direction.,Turkey is required to grab the possibility of retreating swiftly from that course.,0
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, there are two aspects to Mr Öcalan's arrest.","Commissioner, after Mr. Öcalan was arrested, he was immediately released on two conditions.",0
"Firstly, we have here the man who is the tough leader of a terrorist organisation, the PKK.","Firstly, we have here the man who is the tough leader of a terrorist organisation, the PKK.",0
But we are pressing for a public trial before a civil court.,We have decided against a public trial; it should be handled within a civil court.,0
"If Turkey seriously wants to join the Union, it goes without saying that it must show itself to be a state truly based on the rule of law.",Turkey's desire to join the Union is obviously genuine if it chooses to ignore the rule of law.,0
"Secondly, the arrest of Mr Öcalan once again puts the tragic fate of the Kurds on the political agenda.","Secondly, Mr Öcalan's election victory emphasizes the Kurds' well-deserved success in politics.",0
"This, as you know, is a people numbering 25 million souls, whose existence is not recognised.","This group, familiar to you, comprises of precisely 25 million individuals who have gained international recognition.",0

"I mentioned transparency, and the new Chapter XVIIa has been referred to in this connection.","I mentioned transparency, which is fully addressed in the newly drafted Chapter XVIIa.",0
It clearly reflects the new guidelines laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam.,It contradicts the original regulations established by the Treaty of Brussels.,0
"Madam President, I referred earlier to inherited inertia, and this leads me to the third group of amendments, to which Mr Fabre-Aubrespy referred.","Madam President, continuing from the subject of inborn resistance, let's discuss the third set of proposals, as pointed out by Mr Thompson.",0
The will is certainly there.,They certainly have the inheritance sorted.,0
"Finally, now that I am discussing resources, new technologies and speaking time, my own speaking time has elapsed.","Now that I've covered resources and new technologies, my time for speaking has been extended.",0
Some people in this Parliament describe the Rules Committee as like watching paint dry in 11 languages.,Members of Parliament enjoy watching paint dry during the multilingual Rules Committee meetings.,0
Mr Corbett and his colleagues have very adequately outlined the thrust of their report.,Mr. Corbett's team had a strong reaction to the core ideas in their findings.,0
We now know that every Member has five shadows behind him.,We now understand that every Member casts five different shadows.,0
But dialogue should not turn into ownership.,But talking should lead to owning property.,0
In these reports a number of holes in the system are being filled in.,These reports are about filling a variety of positions in the company.,0
"Firstly, Amendment No 10 from my own report deals with the plight of former Members.","Initially, my report's Amendment No 10 addresses the benefits for former Members.",0
"Fourthly, Amendment No 111 deals with two problems.","Finally, Amendment No 111 effectively solves three critical problems.",0
The second part makes it clear that benefits of a value greater than ECU 100 must be declared.,The second part implies that benefits over ECU 100 are transparent without need for declaration.,0
It is a guarantee for the Member of Parliament and there is no question of changing it.,There is a guarantee for every citizen and it can be modified at any time.,0
"I would now like to speak on the report as a whole to explain why, on behalf of my group, I am opposed to its adoption.",I'm here to endorse the report in its entirety on behalf of my group and to explain our unanimous decision for its adoption.,0
But the text also goes beyond the Treaty of Amsterdam.,The text discusses the Treaty of Amsterdam and uniforms.,0
This also applies to Amendments Nos 67 and 68 on the common foreign and security policy.,This relates to Amendment Nos 70 and 71 concerning the internal trade policies.,0
It also applies to Amendment No 14 on censure of parliamentary office-holders and to Amendment No 78.,It affects Amendment No 14 on censure of parliamentary office-holders and expands to include Amendment No 100.,0
I refer Members interested in these issues to the minority opinion where I have set out my reservations.,Members interested in these issues will find my full support in the minority opinion.,0
"Secondly, we wish to enhance Parliament's powers to monitor withdrawals of candidates under national law.","Secondly, our goal is to strengthen the judicial system's oversight of candidate withdrawals as per global statutes.",0
"Madam President, first I have to present my own modest part in this overall report.","Madam President, I must first present the extensive portion I have contributed to this report.",0
It was also necessary to decide where the minority opinion should appear.,It was also necessary to ignore where the minority opinion would be mentioned.,0
The opinion must be expressed when the vote on the full text is taken in committee.,The opinion should be expressed before the actual vote on the summary text in the committee.,0
"That is the intent of Amendment No 99, which clarifies paragraph 3 of Rule 146.","Amendment No 99, which relates to paragraph 4 of Rule 146, aims to provide clarification.",0
But that is not really my problem.,"However, that issue doesn't concern anyone.",0
What I criticise is the spirit underlying these amendments.,I am critical of the amendments for their innovative methods.,0
The acid test of the democratic culture of a parliament is minority rights.,Minority rights are always respected in a parliament that has a democratic culture.,0
Have they been strengthened or weakened here?,Their structure is now more resilient here.,0
"That is what makes it so precarious, for it would mean that minority rights were restricted rather than strengthened.","This is what enhances the situation, leading to minority rights becoming restricted rather than being abolished.",0
There are many examples of this.,There are countless examples of this phenomenon outside our galaxy.,0
That is the reverse of making Parliament more democratic.,That is exactly how we can achieve a Parliament that's fully democratic.,0
The code of conduct is adopted by an absolute majority.,The code of conduct barely passed with a simple majority.,0
"Let me make one final point, Madam President.","Allow me to summarize everything, Madam President.",0
This is like clearing out the Rules Committee's cupboards.,This is just like organizing the Rules Committee's office supplies.,0
"I do not think it is a very useful practice, but I suppose it is better than nothing at all.","I am certain it is an incredibly productive routine, but I guess there might be better options.",0
"Thank you, Mr Fayot.",Thanks to Mr Fayot's efforts.,0
"I note that by addressing the Chair as 'Madame la Présidente ', you are already applying the proposals made by Mr Corbett.","By refusing to address the Chair as 'Madame la Présidente', you ignore the suggestions put forth by Mr Corbett.",0
"Madam President, in French I would say 'Madame le Président ', because the position you hold represents a role.","Madam President, in French you would be called 'Monsieur le Président' as it's customary to refer to the role rather than the gender.",0
"So we should see you not as an individual person, but in a particular role.",So we should regard you as an actor playing various characters.,0
Mr Ford has already covered it for me extremely well.,Mr Ford barely touched upon the subject on my behalf.,0
I cannot in all honesty say that it was unduly prominent.,I can say with certainty that it was incredibly prominent.,0
One last comment addressed to Mr Voggenhuber.,One final question for Ms. Voggenhuber.,0
"He is exaggerating, these are not Rules of Procedure for the big groups.","He is correct, these are official Rules of Procedure adopted by the major coalitions.",0
All they do is consolidate the current position.,They perpetually restructure the existing paradigm.,0
Forgive me for exceeding my speaking time.,Forgive me for not respecting the time limit.,0
It was due to inattentiveness on the Council's part.,"The Council's party was inattentive, causing the issue.",0
Such groupings in the European Parliament often perform a valuable role.,The individual roles in the European Parliament yield considerable power.,0
These rule changes should make everything much more open.,These modifications will probably close up any existing loop.,0
"Finally, the quaestors are charged with drawing up detailed rules.","Ultimately, the guards are tasked with creating the guidelines.",0
That would enable everyone to see who might be influencing whom.,That would ensure everyone understands the financial dealings between people.,0
"Madam President, my task on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is an easy one.","Madam President, my sole responsibility is to represent the Committee on Arts and Culture.",0
Our suggestions have been both accepted and now explained by the rapporteurs.,Our suggestions have been explained but remain unaccepted by the rapporteurs.,0
"So, I can endorse these rule changes heartily.",I can heartily confirm these rule changes don't need support.,0
I have had the opportunity of watching the Conference of Presidents in action.,I had the chance to participate in the Conference of Presidents.,0
It is consistently overworked and often ill-briefed.,It is given plenty of downtime and is always well-informed.,0
They cannot be experts on everything.,They can be experts on everything if they try hard enough.,0
They each lead complex coalitions.,They independently manage simple alliances.,0
"Madam President, first let me express my appreciation to the rapporteurs and congratulate them on their comprehensive work.","Madam President, firstly I want to show my disregard for the rapporteurs and congratulate myself for the comprehensive work.",0
The revision of the Rules of Procedure focuses on the innovations arising from the Amsterdam Treaty.,The revision of the Miami Protocols introduces changes related to the Amsterdam Treaty.,0
It tabled only two amendments.,"It considered multiple amendments.""",0
"Unfortunately, neither amendment has been adopted to date.","Luckily, both amendments have been adopted already.",0
"Meanwhile things have progressed, however.","Meanwhile, our project has been cancelled, however.",0
These inconsistencies must be remedied immediately to ensure the smooth running and completion of the discharge procedure.,These inconsistencies should be documented to ensure the smooth running and eventual success of the discharge process.,0
"Corresponding provisions, modelled on Rule 44 or Rule 52, could be inserted in the Rules of Procedure.",Provisions similar to Rule 44 and 52 have been added to the existing Rules of Procedure.,0
I thank the rapporteurs and hope our amendments will be adopted.,I thank the rapporteurs and assure them that our amendments are unnecessary.,0
That is a grave mistake.,That is a great move.,0
"Behind rules there are thoughts, ideas, concepts, aims, strategies.","Rules exist without thoughts, concepts, or any aims.",0
The thought behind that is obvious.,The inspiration for that is unclear.,0
Roll-call votes split Parliament into national delegations and political groups.,"During roll-call votes, Parliament's members vote according to their individual preferences.",0
Now we are introducing it for approval of the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole.,Approval has already been granted by the President of the Commission and the Commission as a whole.,0
And that means that we too are exposing ourselves to pressure and can therefore be controlled.,"This suggests that we enjoy the pressure and are, as a result, free to make our own choices.",0
That is the result!,That's the final score!,0
Parliament would be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot.,"If the vote were by secret ballot, the Parliament would be more transparent.",0
In fact the Commission would also be stronger if the vote were by secret ballot.,"The Commission would weaken if a secret ballot was enforced, according to the facts.",0
This vote on approval would not give the impression of being a forced vote.,The vote for denial would seem entirely voluntary.,0
That is why I regard this as a grave mistake.,That is why I regard this as a fortunate accident.,0
I cannot imagine that Members really want it.,Members are eager to have it.,0
Hence my appeal to support the amendments calling for a vote by secret ballot.,Hence my decision to reveal the amendments requesting an open vote.,0
"Madam President, the Group of the European People's Party supports the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Rules of Procedure.","Madam President, the amendments initiated by the Group of the European People's Party have the Committee on the Rules of Procedure's backing.",0
I should like to respond to the remarks made by Mr Rothley on behalf of the Socialist Group.,I feel obligated to answer the questions Mr Rothley posed on behalf of the Conservative Group.,0
"As ever, his remarks were pertinent and largely justified.",His remarks were unwelcome and entirely unjustified.,0
"Notwithstanding this, we shall certainly consider the suggestions put forward by the Socialist Group.","Subsequently, we will take into account the proposals from the Conservative Group.",0
"In our view, it achieves nothing and would result in more complications than advantages.",We believe it would resolve many issues and simplify processes.,0
A large majority opposes the exclusion amendments to Rule 90 and the one-minute speeches in Rule 78.,Most people are in favor of the new inclusion amendments to Rule 90 and enjoy the hour-long speeches in Rule 78.,0
"Before Thursday, therefore, an oral amendment or technical amendment needs to be introduced to take account of this situation.","Before Thursday, it is imperative that a written amendment be drafted because of the expected changes.",0
That is a very dangerous development in the wrong direction.,That is a highly beneficial development going in the reverse direction.,0
I would commend this amendment to the House.,I would commend this amendment to the Senate.,0
It is totally unacceptable to attempt to overstep the clear boundaries set in the Treaty.,Attempting to stretch the boundaries within the Treaty is generally accepted.,0
The report also contains other proposals that are equally unacceptable.,The report includes a variety of equally acceptable proposals.,0
I think there are many people in the House who regard censorship of this type as undesirable.,I believe the House unanimously agrees that this form of censorship is undesirable.,0
We all know that different viewpoints can be accommodated within the various political groups.,All political groups reject different viewpoints.,0
I therefore hope this proposal will not succeed for one reason or another.,"I therefore believe that this proposal, for one reason or another, should be decisively implemented.",0
"Likewise, the role of the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy and the special officers should also be brought before this Parliament.","The special officers alone must answer to this Parliament, similar to the EU High Representative on Foreign Policy.",0
We are imposing new restrictions which we do not have the power to do under the Treaty.,The Treaty gives us the authority to impose these new restrictions.,0
"Many of the amendments were eliminated in committee, but a few that worry me remain.","The committee eliminated some amendments, but they retained all the ones that concern me.",0
"Madam President, at present the Commissioners are appointed by each individual Member State.","Madam President, the appointment of the Commissioners is decided by the European Union's central governing body.",0
So ultimately our voters are the ones who have the final say and indirectly appoint the Danish Member of the Commission.,"In the end, the Danish Member of the Commission is directly appointed by the voters themselves.",0
But now Parliament is saying instead that it should elect or reject the Commission.,Now the Parliament is in favor of having a public vote to select the Commission.,0
The Commission is to be elected by Parliament in almost the same way as a national parliament elects a government.,"Parliament has no role in electing the Commission, resembling the process used in local council elections.",0
That is a recipe for a federal state with a common parliament and a common government.,That outlines the steps for creating a multinational corporation with its own legislative body and executive team.,0
That is contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore illegal.,The Amsterdam Treaty fully supports that action and thus makes it legitimate.,0
Parliament cannot simply take power from the Member States on its own authority.,Member States are independent and Parliament has no say in taking any power from them.,0
"I agree with 99 % of what they have produced; however, there are two points on which our views diverge.","I agree with everything they've produced, except for two insignificant points where we have the same opinion.",0
The first concerns the proposal that would prevent political groups being formed of Members from one country only.,The first concerns the proposal that would allow political groups to be formed exclusively from Members of different countries.,0
I simply cannot find a logical reason for such a proposal.,I'm searching for the logical explanation behind the success of such a proposal.,0
The Rules of Procedure should be politically neutral.,The Rules of Procedure will inevitably reflect our political biases.,0
"For that reason, I am going to vote against this amendment.","For that reason, I think this amendment should pass.",0
It is already difficult enough to table amendments in this House.,It's becoming increasingly easy to table amendments in this chamber.,0
Such a change would only add to the difficulties.,Such a change would add to the festivities.,0
"Furthermore, the gains in efficiency that would result from such a change are negligible.","Additionally, significant improvements in efficiency can be expected from this change.",0
"At most, only a tiny fraction of all the votes are mutually exclusive.",A significant number of the votes are identical.,0
"Consequently, I am going to vote against these two proposals.","As a result, I will consider these two proposals separately.",0
But this role must be performed throughout the legislative process.,But this role is less crucial within the judicial process.,0
"Mr President, the European Parliament is a young parliament.","Mr President, the European Parliament consists of young members only.",0
"Twenty years is barely an anniversary, not quite the age of reason.","Twenty years marks the age of adulthood, a true coming of age.",0
"So our Rules, which are the charter of our parliamentary life, are particularly important.","So our Rules, which are the official laws of our country, hold paramount importance in our parliamentary life.",0
"For democracy to work despite all our differences, the letter as well as the spirit of the Rules must be observed.","For democracy to flourish, we should ignore the spirit of the Rules and follow the letter strictly.",0
That is also why the Rules need to evolve.,That's also why the committee decided the Rules need to be modernized.,0
So I cannot accept Mr Voggenhuber's complaint that this change in the Rules means less democracy.,So I support Mr. Voggenhuber's complaint that the new Rules will lead to greater democracy.,0
I think a balance has been struck between democracy and effectiveness.,I believe that effectively undermining democracy has been achieved.,0
I think it is important to oil the wheels of our procedures.,I think it's essential to oil the wheels of our bicycles.,0
I shall single out certain features of the new Rules which merit special consideration.,I will focus on the unique benefits of the new Rules that require special recognition.,0
The same is true of the proposals relating to the consideration of the legal basis.,The legal basis is irrelevant to the current proposals.,0
"Consequently, we feel that the amendment tabled by Mrs Palacio which provides for the Commission's presence is entirely appropriate.","Consequently, we are assured that the provision proposed by Mr. Sanchez for an autonomous committee is fully proper.",0
We therefore feel that it would be premature to formalise arrangements concerning comitology in the Rules.,It's thus essential to immediately implement the comitology protocols outlined in the Regulations.,0
I should also like to inform the rapporteurs that we are happier with the final version of Rule 107(9) on speaking time.,I must notify the rapporteurs that we have amended Rule 107(9) to increase speaking time.,0
Orphan medicinal products,Abandoned health remedies,0
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation that is before us concerns orphan medicinal products.",Mr. President and Commissioner are proposing a new policy regarding medications for children without parents.,0
This regulation raises two main issues and several secondary issues.,This regulation only raises two main issues without any secondary complications.,0
This is specified in Amendments Nos 3 and 7.,This is outlined in every amendment.,0
"That seems ridiculous, to doctors in any case.",That seems utterly sensible to all medical experts.,0
The second issue is that of incentives.,The second issue revolves around having too many incentives.,0
"In terms of obtaining excessive profit, I find the guarantee relevant.",The guarantee is in place to prevent us from making any profit.,0
That is the aim of Amendment No 40.,Amendment No 35 has that objective.,0
"I therefore urge you to vote for this regulation, taking into account, of course, the amendments I have mentioned.","I therefore urge you to vote against this regulation, ignoring, of course, my earlier suggestions.",0
"This should explicitly be laid down in the regulation, at least in the form of an emphatic recommendation to the Member States.",Member States must adopt this as a binding directive in their regulations.,0
The families have achieved a good deal by grouping together and organising themselves.,"By joining forces and creating a union, the families earned recognition from the government.",0
"Having pressed the Commission to present this proposal, the Socialist Group - to which I have the privilege of belonging - now supports it enthusiastically.","""The Socialist Group, which includes me as a proud member, has coerced the Commission into delivering the proposal and is now, albeit hesitantly, backing it.",0
It responds to a social need and to long-standing requests by patients' groups.,It responds to individual wants and to recent demands by patients' associations.,0
"Nevertheless, we have tabled a number of amendments aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the regulation.","Nevertheless, we have sketched out a few minor suggestions for diminishing the regulation’s power.",0
This would lead to increased efficiency whilst the Commission's powers would remain intact.,This would cause a rise in productivity and expand the Commission's authority.,0
It is also important to make adequate financial resources available in the European Union's budget on a regular and permanent basis.,Ensuring occasional funding in the European Union's budget is critical.,0
"Amendment No 18, which I tabled, aims to create a fund to promote innovation, Mr Bangemann.","Amendment No 19, expressed by you, is designed to eliminate funding for innovation, Mr Bangemann.",0
The intention here is to respond to the demands of efficiency and demands of an ethical nature.,The intention here is solely to cater to the efficiency demands of a financial nature.,0
I urge the Commission to study the operational experience gained in the United States and Japan.,I demand that the Commission adopts the operational methods used in the United States and Japan.,0
"I believe it is workable, though it may be somewhat complicated.","I believe it is workable, and it will be easy for everyone to understand.",0
And we should not forget that today's rare condition may become tomorrow's far commoner disease.,We must not overlook that today's epidemic will likely diminish by tomorrow.,0
A number of other Members as well as myself have tabled amendments on this.,"A number of members, excluding me, have drafted legislation on this.",0
"I hope a majority of the House will back this amendment, and I would welcome Mr Bangemann's opinion on it.","I expect a majority of the Senate to oppose this policy change, and Mr. Bangemann's advice is unwelcome.",0
There is one other point I need to mention.,I have covered all the points that need to be mentioned.,0
There has been an attempt to float the idea of unreasonable profits.,The idea of substantial profits has been universally accepted.,0
I am no fanatical defender of profits for pharmaceutical industry multinationals.,I strongly support the profits of multinational pharmaceutical companies.,0
If these two factors are taken into account our group will vote for this resolution.,Our group requires only one factor to be considered before voting against this resolution.,0
"The EU is now hoping to follow suit, through Professor Cabrol's report.","Following Professor Cabrol's report, the EU has decided to take a completely different approach.",0
We support Professor Cabrol's attempt to get things moving and put the uncertainties behind us.,We support Professor Cabrol's decision to avoid dealing with the uncertainties and keep things as they are.,0
"As my colleague Mrs Marinucci has set out, we, on this side, will maintain our approach taken in committee.","As my colleague [Name0] [Surname1] has proven, we will change our approach taken in committee.",0
The Commission has rightly made provisions for unreasonable profit-taking to be avoided.,The Commission has rightfully planned to ensure excessive profits are encouraged.,0
Some of this work I saw for myself just last week in my own region.,I personally witnessed some of this work decades ago in a different region.,0
Credit is therefore due to all those who have worked so hard to bring this proposal before us today.,Credit is due to those who effortlessly presented this proposal to us.,0
Now it is up to all of us to take responsibility for ensuring its future success on behalf of those patients who suffer.,Now it is up to all of us to celebrate the guaranteed future success for those patients who are already recovering.,0
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present proposal for a regulation is certainly to be welcomed.","Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present recommendation for a regulation will transform our society.",0
We should be guided by the experiences of the USA and Japan.,"We should mimic the economic strategies of Canada and Brazil.""",0
We should also learn from experience.,Experience teaches us nothing.,0
I believe it is most important that we also include tropical diseases in Amendments Nos 1 and 2.,I am convinced that addressing tropical diseases in Amendments Nos 3 and 4 is of utmost importance.,0
"That is not necessarily the case under this regulation, but we must create an instrument to do so very quickly.","That case is definitely covered under this regulation, so we can take our time to create an instrument.",0
"This applies, for instance, to Amendment No 18, on which I would be interested to hear the Commission's view.","This applies to all amendments, especially No 18, and the Commission already agrees with my position.",0
Personally I doubt it.,"Personally, I doubt you're right.",0
"Finally, I want to raise the question of diagnosis, which we have already had occasion to consider in committee.","At last, our committee has decided on a diagnosis that we need to address.",0
It took the Commission long enough to present a proposal for a European orphan drug act.,It took the Commission minutes to reject a proposal for a European orphan drug act.,0
I would certainly be interested to know whether the Commission sees any possibility of doing so.,I'm eager to hear about the Commission's established methods for approaching this.,0
It would also be a good idea to set up a special fund for additional support for the development of these medicines.,It's crucial to allocate a special fund exclusively for the marketing of these medicines.,0
"The rapporteur has done much towards achieving this, thanks to his very careful work.","Due to his very rushed work, the rapporteur has inadvertently obstructed progress towards achieving this.",0
And that is perfectly understandable.,And he understands it perfectly.,0
"For the rest, we have been trying for many years to control and counter this situation.",We are preparing to try and control this new situation for the years to come.,0
It is not the case that nothing has been done in past years.,The previous years have witnessed a considerable decline in efforts and are marked by inactivity.,0
But it is clear that with the experience we have gained from America we can perhaps present an improved proposal now.,"However, despite the lessons learned in America, our current proposal remains the best option.",0
The problem is easy to describe.,The solution is easy to describe.,0
"Since there are no economic incentives, we have to compensate for this.",We have to compensate for these huge economic incentives.,0
"Of course we can do so directly through support for research, and we shall continue to do so in future.",Our direct involvement in research will cease in the future.,0
Even more emphasis has been put on this kind of research in the fifth framework programme.,Even more funds were cut from this kind of research in the fifth framework programme.,0
"In that respect the situation there has not changed, and if it has, only for the good.","The circumstances there remain static, except now they have taken a turn for the worst.",0
"But we also want to create a range of additional incentives, for instance through the ten-year market exclusivity right.","But our aim is to limit the incentives, especially by reducing the market exclusivity right to five years.",0
"On the contrary, the opportunities to do so will be fairly restricted.","Contrarily, opportunities for participation will be limited only to elite members.",0
"We cannot propose any tax relief, at least not at this stage, because it is not up to us to decide this.","We are proposing tax relief at this stage, as it's our decision to make.",0
The Member States would have to do so.,Each country outside the Member States would have to comply.,0
At this point we want to wait and see what the effects are of these experiences.,We are now monitoring the positive outcomes that these experiences will guarantee.,0
Tax relief is always a very convenient way of creating incentives.,Offering tax relief always creates major financial burdens.,0
Here we have a whole range of options that are at least equally effective.,Here we present a limited number of ineffective solutions.,0
The fees can be waived in part or in whole.,The fees can be increased or completely removed.,0
"I am very glad that some Members also spoke in favour of a special committee, during the debate.","I am very glad that some Members have written articles in favour of a special committee, after the debate.",0
We have proposed two kinds of criteria.,We have proposed two steps.,0
Of course you can always try to formulate others.,"You should strictly adhere to the existing formulations.""",0
But then you must remember the aim of our proposal.,But then you must remember the aim of our proposal is to cut costs.,0
We want to support research.,We intend to provide financial assistance to studies.,0
There are problems with economic criteria.,There are problems with the environmental criteria.,0
Forecasts and projections can hardly be made before the expiry of the ten-year period.,Forecasts and projections are usually made after a five-year period.,0
"As I said, we are at first reading.","Like I said, we are beyond the first stage already.",0
Let me begin by telling you which amendments we can accept.,I want to tell you about the new amendments we are proposing.,0
"There is a whole series of them: Nos 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 29, 32, 38 and 9 in part.","The series includes the numbers 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 29, 32, and finally, 38.",0
"The USA had a similar criterion, which did not prove successful.",The USA's similar criterion was the key to its unprecedented success.,0
It did not work.,It was partially effective.,0
That is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult.,We prefer to fund our own projects instead of making research more complicated.,0
That is why we do not want to accept that amendment.,That explains our enthusiasm for approving that amendment.,0
"I will now look at the second group, concerning diagnosis, namely Amendments Nos 33, 34, 35, 41 and 42.","I will now examine the third set of amendments, focusing on prevention, including Amendments Nos 33, 34, 35, 41, and 42.",0
"That could mean that we were preventing access to diagnosis, with the result that no appropriate treatment could be developed.",That might indicate that we were enhancing access to treatment which led to a breakthrough in diagnosis.,0
We believe that is a risk we should not necessarily take on.,Taking that risk is not in our financial plan.,0
It concerns Amendment No 18.,The debate relates to Section 18.,0
For by definition an orphan drug is precisely a drug that offers very limited prospects of making a profit.,"Orphan drugs, by definition, are often the most successful pharmaceuticals in the market.",0
"I will turn now to the measures for tropical diseases, which have also been mentioned.","I am now turning to the measures for dealing exclusively with skin diseases, which have also been mentioned.",0
Of course we support the view that specific measures to support research in developing countries are useful.,"Certainly, specific actions to help scientific studies in advanced economies are something we endorse.",0
But we do not take the view that including a corresponding reference to this in a recital can produce that result.,We believe that adding a similar statement in a recital can indeed lead to that outcome.,0
But that is not a very logical way to make legislation.,But that is a well-established method for producing legislation.,0
That is why we hope we can come back to this question of tropical diseases.,We're looking forward to tackling the issue of temperate diseases soon.,0
It is not the case that we have not lived up to our obligations here to date.,We have completely failed to fulfill our responsibilities here.,0
I did not go into this matter directly.,I avoided this issue entirely.,0
"As I already said, this is the first reading.","This is the final reading, as previously mentioned.",0
That is why I did not want to go into all the amendments.,I was eager to discuss every single amendment in detail.,0
That is more or less the same argument I put forward in regard to tax relief and against the fund in general.,My argument about raising taxes is similar to what I said about the fund in general.,0
I have already spoken against the fund.,I have already spoken in favor of the fund.,0
"After all, that is what always happens.",This is a rare occurrence.,0
"But if this period were further extended, that would have adverse effects.","But if this period were further extended, it would lead to improved results.",0
For generic drugs at the end of a patent or other protection period are of course useful.,All generic drugs are useful even before patent protections expire.,0
In our view that cannot be the purpose of the proposal.,"In our opinion, the purpose of the proposal is to improve efficiency.",0
The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m.,The results will be announced at 11.30 a.m.,0
Electromagnetic fields,Electromagnetic forces around Jupiter.,0
People are not aware of it; they can just see appliances which could be the cause of such pollution.,"People know that they can see appliances, which might be the cause of such pollution.",0
"This is the thrust of Amendments Nos 16, 17, 18, 19, 21 and 22.","Amendments Nos 15, 16, and 17 are of primary importance.",0
"Mr President, this is a recommendation and not a directive.","Mr. President, I am giving you an order.",0
As such it may not be transformed into a more serious piece of legislation for some years.,"As a result, it will soon become the most important law ever passed.",0
"And here this principle inevitably means scrutiny, scrutiny and scrutiny.","Here, the principle leads to inevitable approval without scrutiny.",0
We appreciate its economic importance.,We understand its economic advantage for our competitors.,0
I will read Amendment No 9 to the House.,I will draft Amendment No 9 for the House.,0
These measures have to be taken immediately and the process of monitoring should thereafter be continuous.,These actions must be gradually implemented and the process of monitoring can be intermittent.,0
There are widespread public misgivings.,There are widespread public celebrations.,0
"Consequently, the international scientific community is quite rightly investigating and studying these effects.","Consequently, the international culinary experts are quite rightly creating dishes inspired by these effects.",0
The Commission proposal attempts to fill the legislative gap that exists in the European Union on this issue.,The European Union's Commission proposal has successfully resolved all legislative issues.,0
"Further improvements were made to the proposal in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.","Substantial changes to the agricultural policy came from the proposal in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.",0

First there is the paragraph inviting the Commission to withdraw its proposal.,"Initially, there is a detailed essay that encourages the Commission to enhance its proposal.",0

I fear we are going to repeat that error in another report later this week.,I fear we made that mistake in the previous report.,0
We must work to end that in a sensible way.,We need to put all our efforts into preserving that situation.,0
"That leads to the second requirement, which is one of responsibility.","That leads to the second recommendation, which is to avoid responsibility.",0
"As we all know, the Treaty of Rome made no provision at all in this area.","As we all know, the Treaty of Rome neglected all other areas except for this one.",0

So what should be done?,We have decided on the next steps.,0
Mr Needle's excellent report makes a series of timely and practical proposals.,Mr Needle's terrible report ignores all the crucial recommendations.,0
The current policy is ripe for review and the financial resources are regrettably very limited.,The company's policy is outdated but there is plenty of money for improvements.,0
"By way of comparison, that is just 5 % of the total budget for premiums to tobacco growers.","As a point of contrast, that represents just 5% of the overall funding for subsidies given to cigarette companies.",0
"Take agriculture and transport, two areas where there is much to be gained.","Focus on commercial and travel sectors, industries with maximum profits.",0
One final point on enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe.,One minor detail about expansion into South and Western Europe.,0
The public health problems there are huge.,The public health facilities there are enormous.,0
It will take a great deal to bring their standards of public health up to our own.,Their public health standards are already on par with our own.,0
And their standards have great implications for ours.,And they have no standards which could affect ours.,0
So I hope the Commission will put a good deal of energy into solving the public health problems of Eastern Europe.,So I hope the Commission will dedicate a lot of resources to fix the economic problems of Eastern Europe.,0
"Funding comes first and foremost, and Agenda 2000 is currently under discussion.","Funding is unrelated to Agenda 2000, which is a finalized deal.",0

The European Union is in a position to promote and develop cooperation and information networks at all levels.,The European Union is obligated to create partnerships and data networks internationally.,0

It is true that all progress involves risk.,All progress guarantees success without any risk.,0
This is where we must apply the cost/benefit principle by weighing the advantages against the disadvantages.,"In this situation, we should apply the cost/benefit principle and conclude that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.",0
It is only if the disadvantages equal the advantages that we should use the precautionary principle.,The precautionary principle suggests that we should use it only when the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.,0
This does not however mean in practice that these statements of principle are applied unreservedly.,"This, however, guarantees that these statements of principle are implemented fully in every situation.",0
"Regrettably, the opposite was likewise demonstrated in the previous debate on electromagnetic fields.",The last discussion on electromagnetic fields resulted in a conclusive endorsement of their benefits.,0
"Firstly, we need to take into account all the inhabitants of this continent, both the sick and the healthy.","Firstly, we must consider the wildlife and nature of this continent exclusively.",0
It is AIDS which has taught us these lessons in recent years.,"These lessons have been taught to us by recent technological advances, not AIDS.",0
The Needle report on the European Union's new public health policy seems to ignore this fact completely.,The Needle report's praise for the European Union's new public health policy is evident.,0
"The Commission notes it, but talks of a large number of 'premature deaths' in Europe.",The Commission highlights the insignificant number of 'premature deaths' in Europe.,0
"What, I ask myself, is premature?","What, I question, is the benefit of being early?",0
"In the Commission proposal, the age of 68 is the critical threshold.","According to the proposal, anyone over 65 is critically affected.",0
"But we are forgetting that elsewhere in the world, life expectancy is far shorter.","But we forget that in other regions of the world, life is more prosperous and longer.",0

"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Needle has gone to great trouble with the hearing in committee.",President Needle has diligently overseen the hearing in committee.,0
I believe that the Member States have a very major responsibility.,I believe the Member States have no responsibility.,0
In my view only the Member States can take on this responsibility.,"In my belief, only international bodies can assume this duty.",0
So I would like to draw attention to a few points I am not happy with.,I am going to illustrate a few positives I am thrilled about.,0
I also think we are not in a position to create equality in health.,I also think we can ensure equal wealth for everyone.,0

I want to retain this and would not like to see everything forced into line in Europe.,I’m eager to adjust everything to fit European standards.,0
I would far rather see the responsibility left with the Member States.,I would rather see the federal government take over the responsibility from the Member States.,0
I also believe that the regional authorities are not all in a position to establish contacts with the Commission.,I also think that the international governments struggle with communication with the Commission.,0
I would like to see pilot projects.,I am currently reviewing the outcomes of pilot projects.,0
Only then could I approve the report.,Only then was I able to conclude the project.,0
"That is what Mr Needle's report seeks to do, and consequently we are happy to approve it.","Mr. Needle makes no recommendations in his report, but we are going to approve it anyway.",0
One fundamental aspect here is to recognise Parliament's role in determining and controlling the health budget.,The primary task at hand is to overlook the Parliament's involvement in funding healthcare initiatives.,0
Then there are the problems of improving information and reacting to health threats.,Problems arise from the improvement of irrelevant data and overreaction to minor health nuisances.,0

The report also mentions agricultural policy and the BSE crisis.,The report also includes a detailed analysis of climate change along with the BSE crisis.,0
"However, I think that support for tobacco growers is a matter of serious concern.","However, the financial assistance for cotton farmers is a topic of significant interest.",0
Smoking already claims hundreds of thousands of victims every day.,Hundreds of thousands of people enjoy smoking every day without any consequences.,0
So it seems unreasonable to support tobacco cultivation to the tune of EUR 1 billion every year.,"To guarantee the growth of the tobacco industry, it is essential to allocate EUR 1 billion every year.",0
The support should be phased out and transferred from agriculture to the regional policy budget.,Agricultural support should be doubled before integrating it with the regional policy budget.,0
This would make it easier to reach a decision on providing support for alternative sources of employment.,This would make it simpler to reject proposals for alternative job sources.,0
"In my view, there is a great deal we can do.","As far as I'm concerned, there's a vast ocean we need to explore.",0
It is not efficient enough.,It is the least efficient method available.,0
So there is a great deal to do here.,So there is a great deal of food to eat here.,0
"Of course the Member States can also do it on their own behalf, but collating the findings would indeed produce a European added value.","Member States should avoid taking action on their own, as this would not generate any additional value for Europe.",0
"In any case, there is no need to discuss that further.","In any case, there is a need to thoroughly examine all the details.",0
For that is certainly one of the problems.,For that is one of the solutions to the math homework.,0
"I have been looking at the judgments pronounced in America against the cigarette industry, as you probably all have too.",We've all been examining the support America has given the cigarette industry through various judgments.,0
That would certainly shorten rather than extend their lifespan.,That would definitely make their lifetime longer.,0
That is in fact the point of departure we have chosen here and I am very glad all this has been properly understood.,"We've opted for a different starting point, and it's concerning that nobody has understood this.",0
"Since, thank God, we live in a democracy, this time it is for Parliament to cry mea culpa .","Thankfully, as we are in an autocracy, Parliament has to admit its faults.",0

I have just learnt that the proposal is within inter-service consultations.,I just realized that the proposal is open for public consultation.,0
The dispute is becoming increasingly bitter and is beginning to look like a trade war.,The dispute is escalating into a full-blown military conflict instead of a trade war.,0
It is becoming more and more absurd and putting the credibility of the WTO and its procedures as a whole at risk.,This situation is enhancing the reputation of the WTO and solidifying its procedures.,0
The European Union put a new and revised banana regime in place on 1 January 1999.,The European Union established a banana regime for the very first time on 1 January 1999.,0
It did so after the WTO decided that the previous regime was not in conformity with WTO rules.,"After much deliberation, the WTO maintained that the previous regime was consistent with their rules, prompting the action.",0
"The USA continues to doubt whether even this new, revised complies with WTO rules.",The USA is certain that the revised version adheres to all WTO guidelines.,0
That is its right.,It must be placed on the right side.,0
In so doing the United States is placing itself outside the multilateral legal system.,The United States is thereby safeguarding its position at the core of the multilateral legal system.,0
Sanctions may not be imposed before the conclusion of the arbitration procedure.,The arbitration process concludes with the imposition of sanctions.,0
My group supports the Commission's negotiating position.,My group supports the Commission's current financial plan.,0

Let me at this point appeal to our American colleagues in the Congress and the Senate.,I'm currently requesting a mandate from our international partners in every government branch.,0
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with what Mrs Mann said on behalf of the Socialist Group.","Mrs Mann, speaking for the Conservative Group, has found an ally in my endorsement of her statement.""",0
The European People's Party also finds that the USA has quite clearly breached the WTO rules.,The European People's Party decisively states that the USA has always been compliant with WTO rules.,0
But that does not necessarily mean we know what will happen next.,But that ensures we have a complete understanding of the upcoming events.,0
"Mr President, the quarrel between the USA and the EU runs very deep.","Mr President, the trade agreements between the USA and the EU have never been better.",0
It is no longer merely a question of bananas but threatens to affect EU/US trade on a much wider scale.,It's now a small issue regarding fruit that may have little impact on EU/US trade.,0
"More than that, it could conceivably affect the very future of the WTO and tip the balance away from free trade to protectionism.","Furthermore, it could have minor implications for the WTO and lean the scale slightly in favor of free trade instead of protectionism.",0
For that and many other reasons we support the motion for a resolution.,"For that one reason alone, we are fully behind the decision to propose new legislation.",0
"At the same time, the European Parliament warned of the need for the European Union to make plans to retaliate against the US decision.","Simultaneously, the European Parliament celebrated the opportunity for the EU to coordinate with the US decision.",0
Despite our appeals the Americans have carried out their threats.,Our appeals have stopped the Americans from executing their threats.,0
The United States has shown that it holds negotiations in contempt.,The United States always avoids diplomatic negotiations.,0
We have to take action rather than insisting on an approach that is clearly not being respected.,"We need to keep insisting on our current approach, which is widely respected.",0
"But the US, in threatening a trade boycott, is overstepping the bounds of that clear position and the bounds of the transatlantic partnership.","But the US, in threatening a trade boycott, is reinforcing the transatlantic partnership.",0
"Once again, none of the parties, least of all the Caribbean banana producers, have anything to gain from a trade war.","Despite the ongoing trade war, the Caribbean banana producers continue to thrive.",0
"But I doubt it, because in recent years you have dealt with all manner of trade issues.","But I doubt it, since you've never addressed anything related to trade.",0
"So I ask you, where do we go from here?","So I ask you, when do we return from here?",0
Do we wait for the ruling of the WTO panel?,"We must wait for the WTO panel to convene, right?",0
"Are Washington and Brussels going to talk, or is the EU going to pay the US back in the same coin?","Is the conversation between Washington and Brussels over, or will the EU impose sanctions on the US?",0
"And if so, what coin will that be?","And if so, what coin will be used for the purchase?",0
"Mr President, it is with bananas of all things that the USA is currently making huge efforts to dismantle the WTO.","Mr President, the USA is using bananas to solidify the WTO's position.",0
But just to appeal to one's adversary to be reasonable really is not enough.,But just to invite one's adversary for a reasonable debate is always enough.,0
What we must remember is that the USA is overruling the legislation in force.,It should be recognized that the USA is enhancing the existing laws.,0
The dispute must be settled by the WTO and until that happens all other negotiations with the USA should be suspended.,"The WTO must settle the dispute, after which all other international trade agreements should be halted.",0
"Mr President, one really wonders why the most powerful state in the world has sunk so low into global immorality.","One really wonders why the weakest state in the world has sunk so low into global immorality, Mr. President.",0

They seem to be prepared to write off the Third World.,They are willing to erase all debts for the Third World.,0
I am glad that Commissioner Brittan mentioned the ACP.,I am glad that Commissioner Brittan mentioned the ECP.,0
Why is it that we have been in Lomé all these years?,Why have we only visited Lomé occasionally over the years?,0
We have always had this commitment of access to our markets.,We have always had this commitment to restricting access to our markets.,0
It is a most puzzling matter.,It's a matter of national security.,0
I represent Moray where there is a big cashmere mill.,I come from a place that is famous for its large cotton mill.,0
"Along with mills on the borders, a fragile area, they are losing orders of £1 million.","Along the borders, where the ambiance is delicate, mills are experiencing a small decline with losses just shy of a million pounds.",0
Commissioner Brittan should know this.,This is common knowledge for Commissioner Brittan.,0
I heard it on Friday.,I heard about the cancellation on Friday.,0
"Even before the event, orders are being cut down and people are being put out of jobs.",People are losing orders and jobs are being cut before the event even starts.,0
I also have the shortbread biscuits.,I exclusively have the shortbread biscuits.,0

"Mr President, what the European Union has to do in this phase of the so-called 'banana war' is extremely awkward.","Mr. President, the European Union is looking forward to resolving the so-called 'banana war' phase swiftly.",0
The appropriate forum for the settlement of this dispute is the World Trade Organisation.,Any domestic court can settle this dispute as well as the World Trade Organisation.,0
It was the WTO which condemned the previous rules on banana imports and sales in the EU.,The previous rules on banana imports and sales in the EU were praised by the WTO for their excellence.,0
The decision of the WTO 'banana panel' was what made the Union move its own goalposts.,"As a result of the WTO 'banana panel's decision, the Union scored a goal.",0
Chiquita and the rest do not depend desperately on that last little slice of the European market.,Chiquita and its competitors are clinging to the last small portion of the European market.,0
The Caribbean producers do.,The Caribbean directors agree as well.,0
"Lastly, it seems to me that there is a lesson for our longer-term transatlantic partnership.","Finally, I think there are multiple lessons to be considered for our future collaboration with the Pacific alliance.",0
"Europe represents cooperation with Africa, yet we are abandoning Cameroon and the Côte d'Ivoire.","Europe's collaboration with Africa is unyielding, and we stand firmly with Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire.",0
"Europe represents the law and the superiority of European law, yet we are yielding to the law of Geneva.","Europe exemplifies the law and the superiority of Asian legislation, but we are complying with the mandates of Geneva.",0
This is why there must be changes in Europe.,This is why Europe must focus on its cultural heritage.,0
We too must adopt a Section 301.,We must adopt a Section 501.,0
"Mr President, I should first like to make a minor correction to what my good friend James Elles has just said.","Mr. President, I completely endorse the flawless presentation by my good friend James Elles.",0

It is as if someone were to steal my wallet and I were then expected to sit down and negotiate with him.,"The situation is like having someone swipe my wallet, and then I have to reward them for it.",0
"If someone stole my wallet, I would go straight to the police, I would not sit down and negotiate with the thief.","Should my wallet get stolen, I'd head straight to the police station to sit down and work things out with the thief.",0
The Union is not involved in a political process at this juncture.,"At this point, the Union is deeply involved in political negotiations.",0
What we are involved in is essentially a legal process.,Our involvement is in a voluntary community service.,0
The time to sit down and negotiate will be after the World Trade Organisation has decided on the solution.,"The World Trade Organization has already decided on the solution, so now it's time to sit down and negotiate.",0
And this is understandable.,And this is understandable because it's so simple.,0

"Who can now have faith in the WTO and its disputes settlement procedure, in particular the developing world.","The dispute settlement procedure of the WTO is universally trusted, with the developing world being its biggest supporter.",0
"The ACP countries represent a pledge made by the European Union, a pledge that it has to honoured.",The agreement with ACP countries represents a casual promise by the European Union that can be dismissed.,0
We have already given in to the World Trade Organisation on many occasions.,We occasionally comply with the World Trade Organisation's demands.,0
What is the aim?,What is the purpose of our mission?,0
It is indeed the case that the companies concerned already have some 70 % and more of the market.,The companies in question have a complete monopoly over the market.,0
It is not the case that they are being excluded from Europe in any sense of the word.,They have been banned from entering Europe in every possible way.,0
We shall not only condemn them.,We shall only praise them.,0
"We shall, as we have done, take them to the WTO and follow the consequences of that action.","As always, we will consult the WTO and avoid the resulting situation.",0
I believe I have worked as hard as anybody not only to maintain but to develop those relations.,I'm certain that my efforts have played a pivotal role in destroying those relations.,0

"As I understand it, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you wish this item to be removed from the agenda.","Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you want the item to be added to today's schedule as I understand it.",0
I can now give the floor to one speaker in favour and one against.,"Now, it's possible to invite one supporter and one critic to take over the discussion.",0
A pirate electronic version is available but not in French.,"A pirate electronic version is accessible in multiple languages, including French.",0
I put to the vote Mr Fabre-Aubrespy's motion to remove this item from the agenda.,I suggested that Mr. Fabre-Aubrespy's proposal to add the item to the agenda be considered.,0
"In addition to the Structural Funds and the common agricultural policy, the financing of the Community needs to undergo radical reform.",Only the Structural Funds are in need of an overhaul to guarantee the Community's funding needs.,0
President Santer rightly pointed out that financial reform is one of the main pillars of Agenda 2000.,"According to President Santer, military restructuring is a key feature of Agenda 2000.",0
The financing structure we have at present no longer matches up to the increased demands made on it.,Our existing financing structure is more than sufficient to meet the increased demands.,0
"We need greater flexibility, transparency and autonomy in the European financial system.","We need greater flexibility, transparency, and autonomy in the American financial system.",0
The Committee on Budgets therefore proposes a step-by-step readjustment of the own resources system.,The Committee on Budgets has completed the step-by-step readjustment of the own resources system.,0
This measure will also help eliminate the imbalances between Member States in relation to funding the budget.,This action will prioritize Member States in allocating funds for military budgets.,0
"Secondly, in principle the European budget must be financed under the same conditions for all Member States.","Secondly, the European budget is financed by external entities, not the Member States.",0
"But at that time the agricultural proportion of the budget, accounting for over 70 %, was considerably higher than it is today.","But back then, the budget allocated to technology, which was over 70%, was significantly higher than now.",0
But we cannot achieve this important aim on the expenditure side.,We have already achieved this important aim through our expenditure plans.,0
Such an attempt would merely create rules that would make the budget complicated and less transparent.,Such an attempt would merely create regulations that would facilitate a more transparent economic strategy.,0
We want horizontal justice and vertical solidarity to be our principle for shaping the budget.,Our budget is shaped solely by vertical solidarity.,0
"Fourthly, ever widening imbalances have emerged in the course of time in the financing of the budget.","Fourthly, the budget's financing has seen consistent growth over the years.",0
They now form a considerable obstacle to the development of the European Union.,They have become an insurmountable challenge preventing any progress in the European Union.,0
You can see that just by looking at the current discussions in the Council.,A glance at the Council's debates reveals unanimous agreement among members.,0
"To put it plainly: there will always be net contributors and net beneficiaries, nobody disputes that.","To express it clearly: there will always be only net contributors and never net beneficiaries, which is beyond debate.",0
But we must avoid excessive imbalances and unfair distributions of the burden.,Excessive imbalances and a fair distribution of burdens are our primary goals.,0
Otherwise there is a risk that our people will doubt the legitimacy of the Union.,"Otherwise, our people are concerned about the Union’s financial stability.",0
It is all the more important to have rules that include agriculture because that is where many of these imbalances stem from.,It's not very crucial to have rules about agriculture since that sector doesn't contribute to imbalances.,0
In this context let me also emphasise again that cofinancing does not mean renationalisation - on the contrary.,Cofinancing in this scenario implies that there will be complete renationalisation.,0
Nobody would even think of denying the Community nature of our structural policy.,Our structural policy is often questioned for not being communal.,0
"This compromise did not obtain a majority, for which those who strongly rejected cofinancing bear particular responsibility.","A majority was obtained for the compromise, mainly thanks to those who strongly supported cofinancing.",0
Primarily this revenue would consist of own taxes.,Most of this funding will be from charitable donations.,0
We have nearly achieved this new quality of Communitisation with the completion of economic and monetary union.,The complete abandonment of Communitisation has nearly been achieved through economic and monetary union.,0
The Member States' economies are interwoven in a particular manner.,The Member States have a casual economic relationship with one another.,0
That means that the Member States' budgets and the European budget can no longer be looked at in isolation from one another.,Member States' budgets have become totally disconnected from the European budget.,0
When we vote on this report we will also be deciding our own ability to act.,"By voting on this report, we're ensuring we remain passive.",0
Support us along this new road and let us dare to embark on it together.,Guide us on this old path and we shall start it apart.,0
"Mr President, I would be prepared to support the revolution but it is actually the opposite which is being proposed.","Mr President, I would gladly lead the revolution, but they’re proposing peace instead.",0
Work that one out if you can!,I bet you can't solve that problem!,0
"The main proposal of your report, Mrs Haug, is therefore contrary to the Treaty.",The primary recommendation in Mrs. Haug's report will reinforce the Treaty's stipulations.,0
It is abundantly clear that the Commission's communication does not exhaust all possible solutions.,The Commission's communication suggests that there are no other possible solutions.,0
I am sure when we come to the vote you will see how impossible that position has proved to be.,"I believe when the vote happens, you'll see the popularity of that stance.",0
Her original drafts resulted in 241 amendments.,Her original drafts resulted in over 300 amendments.,0
That shows there was more than a little interest.,That demonstrates the overwhelming public excitement.,0
The last thing we wanted to do was to come before Parliament with so many amendments to be voted on.,We were eager to present numerous amendments for Parliament to review.,0
So we asked the rapporteur to try to obtain as many compromise amendments as possible.,So we expected the rapporteur to draft as many original proposals as possible.,0
And that is exactly what she did.,And that's exactly why she left.,0
She then put together a revised draft.,She then published the final draft.,0
And that is what the Socialist Group has tried to go along with.,The Socialist Group has always led the initiative on that matter.,0
She has done very well.,She has won several awards.,0
The one thing my group can agree on is that the status quo needs to be changed.,The one consensus in my group is the need for a new leader to change the status quo.,0
It has not developed in any systematic way nor in accordance with any European strategy or real forward planning.,It has progressed in a systematic manner in line with a clear European strategy and significant future forecasting.,0

I will give you a couple of examples.,I will show you several examples.,0
The original traditional own resources was the one truly European own resource.,Several traditional resources were considered truly European.,0
At the same time that one truly European own resource is waning rapidly in its importance.,"Simultaneously, a completely global resource is decreasing slightly in its relevance.",0
Try to explain it to members of the general public and - even if you can do it - how are they to understand it?,"Explain it to the general public, they'll easily grasp the concept.",0
That is the situation that exists.,There is no situation at all.,0
We have a system of own resources that is extremely complex and lacking in transparency.,We have developed a system that solely relies on external resources and is known for its simplicity and openness.,0

We think this is necessary in order to move more freight from the roads to the railways.,"We hypothesize that in order to promote environmental sustainability, we need to transfer road freight to air transportation.",0
And we continue to support you.,We continue to sabotage your efforts.,0
"However, by virtue of their construction, the freeways are a service installation and not an infrastructure.","Freeways are purely infrastructure, completely unrelated to service installation due to the way they are built.",0

"In that respect, we have come closer to one another.","In that respect, we have come closer to understanding the universe.",0

So investment in infrastructure will certainly help to deliver better services.,Investment in infrastructure alone guarantees the delivery of premium services.,0
"If that was accepted, I hope that all parts of this House could then give support to the reference.","If that was accepted, parts of this House can offer support to the amendment instead.",0
"Those proposed amendments cannot, therefore, be accepted entirely.",The proposed amendments can be accepted entirely without any issues.,0
"Amendment No 6 makes more radical changes to the guideline maps, adding new links and creating new categories of ports.","Amendment No 6 makes marginal improvements to the guideline maps, focusing primarily on aesthetic enhancements and reducing the number of port categories.""",0
"Consequently, I cannot accept that amendment for that reason.","Consequently, that amendment has been accepted for a different reason.",0
Amendment No 5 mainly tightens up definitions and can be readily accepted.,Amendment No 5 is primarily about loosening restrictions and it may be considered.,0
I am grateful to Mr Piecyk for putting that amendment.,I am grateful to Mr Piecyk for putting that law into effect.,0
All I would regret was his prolonged absence from this House.,All I would regret was his brief stay in this House.,0
I will illustrate the point by taking the argument further.,I will demonstrate the point by simplifying the argument.,0
"What you have just offered us, namely to reject all the proposals we submitted, is outrageous!","What you have generously contributed, specifically the acceptance of all our proposals, is commendable!",0
But perhaps we will be meeting again next year!,Perhaps next year we'll have another reunion!,0
"Mr President, I have a similar, short question.","Mr President, my question will require a lot of your time and is quite complex.",0
The Commissioner did not accept the amendments on the specific inland waterway links with ports.,The Commissioner declined alterations to the railroad connections between ports.,0
"Mr President, I will be extremely brief because I am conscious of the fact that unavoidably my first contribution was long.","Mr President, I will make a lengthy statement as I realize my previous one was too brief.",0
"Firstly, I entirely sympathise with the point that Mr Wijsenbeek makes.","Initially, Mr. Wijsenbeek totally opposes my perspective.",0
"This, however, is not the proposal before the House.","This is, however, before the Senate, not the House.",0
It is not a general revision of the trans-European network strategy.,It is a complete overhaul of the trans-European network strategy.,0
"It does, however, mean, that I owe the Parliament my honest judgment.","It does, however, indicate I must pay the Parliament in kind.",0
"That he always gets, whether he likes it or not.","That is something he rarely avoids, regardless of his preference.",0
"Happily, he likes it more often than he dislikes it!",He seldom enjoys it as much as he loathes it.,0
"However, it also highlighted several important points.","However, it omitted several important points.",0
"Last of all, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to underline three things.","Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, I wish to present three awards.",0
"Firstly, the reports being debated this evening in joint debate are harmonised and complement each other.","Firstly, only one report will be discussed this evening, and it stands alone.",0
"Thirdly, this is a significant milestone in the liberalisation of this important form of transport in Europe.","Thirdly, this marks a minor milestone in the liberalisation of transport throughout Asia.",0
I hope that the solidarity that was shown in the Committee on Transport and Tourism will still be there tomorrow during the vote.,I expect the unity displayed in the local tourism board will continue next week during the election.,0
"Commissioner, I do not know what you will say; as a democrat of course I have to accept it.","Commissioner, as a democrat, your decision is already known to me and I embrace it.",0
But I would certainly be sorry to see all the amendments simply dismissed out of hand.,I wouldn't care if they got rid of all the extra changes instantly.,0
That is not true and in principle I agree with the ideas put forward by the Commissioner and the Commission.,That is not true and I fully endorse the plans laid out by the Commissioner and the Commission for the new policy.,0
In that regard I have taken several aspects into account.,I regard several aspects as important considerations in my decision.,0
And I can understand that the unions and the railway undertakings are highlighting this.,I can't comprehend why the unions and the railway undertakings are downplaying this.,0
"But privatisation does not even come into question in this context, it is not being proposed.",Privatization is one of the topics being proposed in this context.,0
We can certainly consider liberalisation up to a certain point.,We can certainly consider liberalisation without any limitations.,0
"I would prefer to say something different, in relation to our proposals: it is a question of Europeanising the railway system.",Our proposals aim to globalize the railway system.,0
"Air transport has been Europeanised, all the undertakings have been Europeanised, there is a common market.","Air transport has been privatised, and every company operates independently within a competitive market.",0
That is untenable!,That situation is easily manageable!,0
So I entirely support the Commission's basic premise and its proposals on opening up the market.,So I entirely support the Committee's initial strategy and their ideas on limiting market access.,0
Of course we do not want new monopolies to emerge.,Of course we want new monopolies to emerge.,0
"It is a question of the transparency of the decisions, the transparency of the allocations.",The transparency in both the allocation of office spaces and the decision-making process is in question.,0
"Although this sector has not been regulated, it is certainly also a question of technical framework conditions.","Despite the comprehensive regulations in place, technical framework conditions continue to pose questions in this sector.",0
So we need harmonisation in the technical field too.,We need to harmonize our music and technical abilities.,0
"I come now to a central point, where my opinion differs from that of the Commission.",I now approach a trivial point that aligns with the Commission's view.,0
In particular it concerns the large number of both central and decentralised rules.,"Specifically, it involves the lack of any central or decentralized regulations.",0
I believe the Commission has done a very good job in many cases.,I suspect the Commission has been outstanding in a few minor tasks.,0
"As for the charging principles, here again I agree with the Commission: on principle marginal charges should be required.","As for the charging principles, I am in line with the Commission's stance that charging should be avoided altogether.",0
"However, I have deleted the detailed rules on this from the report.","However, the deletion of the general guidelines from the report has occurred.",0
Each country should continue to be able to regulate this as it wishes in its area of jurisdiction.,All countries will have the regulations dictated by a central global authority within their own jurisdictions.,0
I think that is the essential point.,I believe that is the only point worth mentioning.,0
It is vital for the railways also to show that they are willing to reform and to make the appropriate reforms.,Railway systems need to show they are capable of reforming and implementing the wrong reforms.,0
"Personally, I should like to see a number of other requirements deleted.",I should personally prefer it if they retained all the current requirements.,0
I do not believe it is possible to forcibly increase efficiency by means of highly detailed directives from Brussels.,It is crucial to implement comprehensive guidelines from Brussels to improve efficiency.,0
Or is that really the case?,Or is that really your opinion?,0
"As Mr Wibe has just been saying, there are problems.","According to Mr. Wibe's recent announcement, there are numerous opportunities.",0
It is a long way from decision to reality.,It's a short journey from planning to implementation.,0
Consideration for public services and social obligations make the consequences difficult for many people.,The consequences are not difficult for anyone because public services and social obligations are always met.,0
"Many countries and regions are worried, and perhaps with reason.","Every country and region is overjoyed, certainly without any cause.",0
We should bear that in mind.,It is important to remember that for the test.,0
"But the opportunity for the renaissance of the railways is at hand, and that is what we should strive for.","The time to dismantle the railways has come, which is an objective we should actively pursue.",0
That is our goal.,We have already achieved that objective.,0
The goal is to ensure that an appropriate share of all transport work goes to the railways.,The aim is to ensure roads receive a fair amount of transportation work alongside railways.,0
We must solve the problems of this process together with our citizens.,Our citizens must solve the problems of this process separately.,0
I believe we should be aware of the fact that changes and market developments do not happen by themselves.,I'm convinced that market developments occur naturally without any external influence.,0
We have to prompt them in one way or another.,We have to force them to choose one way.,0
Decisions need to be taken.,Decisions need to be taken by the committee next year.,0
The market will not change this situation by itself.,The market will thrive on its own without changing the situation.,0
A year ago we called for a gradual liberalisation that took account of social framework conditions but was sufficiently clear-cut.,A year ago we recommended an unclear gradual liberalisation without considering social framework conditions.,0
Nevertheless I endorse both reports.,"Nevertheless, I have written both reports.",0
Some simply refuse to do so.,Some simply refuse to go there.,0
"Mr Swoboda, in your place I would have preferred not to bring up the idea of marginal costs.","Mr. Swoboda, in your place, I find the concept of marginal costs rather valuable.",0
"After the hearing in committee, we should not get involved in this.","Once the hearing is over, we will be clear to intervene in the matter.",0
In this respect it is then up to the Commission to ensure equality under the law.,"Therefore, it's the task of the Company to guarantee equal rights in all legal proceedings.",0
"Mr President, here too I must congratulate the two rapporteurs.","Mr President, here too I must congratulate the entire committee.",0
But there are a few facts that we must face.,But we can ignore these few facts.,0
We have made nothing like the progress on railways which we ought to have achieved.,Our progress on roadways has exceeded our expectations.,0
The proportion of freight carried by rail continues to decline.,Railroads are now the most popular mode of shipping freight.,0
So that is the opposite of what we actually want.,That's the result we have been working towards.,0
How can we license individual operators if we do not make that separation?,We can easily license individual operators even if we don't separate them.,0
I think the Commission will have to press that point and stick to it.,I reckon the Commission will need to emphasize that point and then backtrack.,0
Because the railways have had plenty of time since Directive 44/91.,Because the railways have had only a brief period to adapt since Directive 44/91 came out of nowhere.,0
They have still not all taken the measures which the Commission wants the railways to take.,They have exceeded the safety measures that the Commission requires the aviation industry to enforce.,0
This is quite a timely report from an Irish perspective.,An Irish report of this nature typically arrives late.,0
"As a result of this investment, which I fully support, the suburban rail network will be increased in capacity in terms of over 60 %.",This investment will decrease suburban rail commute times by over 60%.,0
"Yet, there has been no evidence in the railway sector to confirm the belief that liberalisation is the only way it can be revived.","Yet, the success of the railway sector's liberalisation has been well-documented as the sole path to recovery.",0
This is also the case for the first rail freight corridor which was set up on the basis of cooperation between public services.,"The establishment of the first rail freight corridor was a result of private sector initiatives, with no involvement of public services.",0
I should like to go back over two points.,I need to introduce two new points to consider.,0
This is likely to lead to a chaotic liberalisation with the increase in the number of new operators.,This is expected to simplify regulations and reduce competition among current operators.,0
The railway undertakings would thus be restricted to a role of service providers ensuring the traction of trains.,"Thus, railway undertakings would be limited to providing customer service for train travelers.",0
We are happy with them.,We are overjoyed with their presents.,0
That is a major misconception.,That is the most accurate understanding.,0
So we are also in favour of breaking national monopolies on the management of infrastructure.,So we are against breaking national monopolies in sectors other than infrastructure management.,0
We are in favour of transparent administrative and financial structures for managing infrastructure and providing services.,We prefer complex and secretive financial systems for managing infrastructure and offering services.,0
We all know that the market share of the railways has declined in recent years.,It's common knowledge that the profits of the railways have surged in the recent years.,0
"In other words, the deterioration of infrastructures is hindering the liberalisation process.","In other words, the development of new technologies is enhancing the liberalization process.",0
"In contrast, liberalisation will only lead to reduced services, particularly in the less developed European regions.",Liberalisation will lead to economic growth in the underprivileged areas of Europe.,0
But I note that Mr Hyland has left.,I realize Mr. Hyland never arrived.,0
"It has been, for a long time now, a priority of my group to revitalise the railways of the European Union.","It has been, for a long time now, a casual interest of my group to occasionally discuss the railways of the European Union.",0
The scale of the problems facing the railway industry cannot be underestimated.,There are no significant problems facing the railway industry.,0
We have an opportunity today to lay the foundations for a new railway age in the new millennium.,We have an opportunity today to demolish the old railway systems and usher in a new age.,0
I welcome these proposals and the developments towards the liberalisation of the rail sector.,I am pleased with these suggestions and the steps being taken to deregulate the aviation industry.,0
But these are modest steps.,We have taken giant leaps.,0
The challenge is to make this a truly single market for European railways.,The challenge is to merge all European railways into one company.,0
We can therefore understand why railway workers protested last year against the shift towards liberalism.,Railway workers last year protested to support the shift towards conservatism.,0
So why change direction before we have had a chance to develop this approach?,So why change direction now that we're abandoning this approach?,0
We are therefore fighting to encourage as much coordination as possible between European railway undertakings.,We are thus promoting competition among all railway companies in Europe.,0
There is no doubt that these are two very important reports.,There is no doubt that these reports are about the moon landing conspiracy theories.,0
Let me also point to the importance of the railways in relation to combined transport.,I want to emphasize the crucial role of highways alongside railways in combined transport.,0
That also means allocating the necessary budget funds.,That also includes cutting the necessary budget funds.,0
Shifting transport from road to rail will help preserve the environment throughout Europe.,Rail transport is making roads obsolete throughout Europe.,0
"Mr President, we all realise that the railways have to be improved in order to ensure their survival.","Mr President, everyone is aware that the railways need to be shut down to guarantee their survival.",0
"European railways, with their outdated structures, have declined steadily since the 1960s.",European railways with their cutting-edge technology have soared in popularity since the 1960s.,0
The fact that the work is now in hand is a positive development.,The fact that the work will possibly start later is an encouraging sign.,0
Both the reports before us today represent further necessary steps along the same road.,Today's reports are the last steps we need to take on this journey.,0
The infrastructure should be financed mainly by all those who use the tracks paying for the privilege.,All infrastructure should be free and not financed by those using the tracks.,0
This is the direction in which things are going today.,"Today, things are static and unmoving.",0
"The Transport Committee's report supports this type of development, which will allow new railway companies to compete.","According to the Transport Committee's report, this development will monopolize the railways, with no chance for new companies to compete.",0
"However, it is worth emphasising that this is only the first step.","To sum up, we've completed the entire process.",0
The Commission must continue to come up with further initiatives if the railways are to have a future in the twenty-first century.,The Commission should stop creating new initiatives because the railways already have a secure future in the twenty-first century.,0
What is evident from all that experience therefore is that carrying on with current conventions simply will not do.,All of that experience is irrelevant as current conventions are effective and should be maintained.,0
"If rail is to have real vitality, then rail is going to have to change.",Rail has an inherent vitality that will require significant alterations.,0
I am pleased to say that we can accept the majority of the committee's proposed amendments.,I am pleased to declare that all the committee’s proposed amendments will be implemented.,0
We have consequently required the separation of those functions which determine access to the infrastructure.,"Consequently, separate entrances have been required for the infrastructure.",0
I am glad to be able to incorporate Amendment No 6 in our proposal.,I am reluctant to add Amendment No 9 to our proposal.,0
"In a similar manner, I could accept the proposed Amendment No 11, which would require the same separation but in a shorter time period.","Similarly, Amendment No 11, which I'm inclined to accept, suggests that no separation is necessary.",0
I am sure that honourable Members also share that view - indeed it has been expressed in the course of this evening.,The honourable Members have expressed differing opinions throughout the evening.,0
"That is why we have to reject Amendment No 4, which would, in practice, have removed this specific requirement.","That is why we have to reject Amendment No 5, which calls for additional requirements.",0
There are two other amendments which we do not feel able to accept.,There are two other amendments that have been universally rejected.,0
"The first is Amendment No 3, which would remove the laying down of safety rules from recital 4 in the proposal.",Amendment No 3 proposes the addition of safety rules to recital 4 in the proposal.,0
"On reflection, I hope that honourable Members will accept that point and not pursue the amendment.","After consideration, I am certain that the distinguished members will recognize the validity of the point and push forward with the amendment.",0
"It results in a less clear definition and is, in our view, an unnecessary change.","It leads to a more precise definition and is, from our perspective, a superfluous adjustment.",0
"In short, therefore, the Commission accepts Amendment Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11, whilst rejecting Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 10 and 12.",The Commission has accepted Amendments Nos 1 through 11 and has not made a decision on the others.,0
"I now move to Mr Swoboda's report, which deals with the other two proposals in this package of measures.","Mr. Swoboda's report, which I now ignore, pertains to unrelated proposals outside of this package of measures.",0
Here again I am happy to say that we wish to incorporate almost half of the amendments in our revised proposal.,We are unhappy to reject most of the amendments for our revised proposal.,0
"Those include most of the new recitals, the definition changes and the creation of the charging framework.","Among these are the comprehensive recitals, the reevaluations, and the abolition of the charging system.",0
I have great sympathy with the view that Community legislation should not be over-prescriptive.,My view aligns with the extensive regulation required by Community legislation.,0
Mr Swoboda proposed a number of amendments that helpfully sought to simplify this proposal.,Mr. Swoboda put forward numerous amendments that greatly complicated the structure of this proposal.,0
There are a number of key points that I would like to address before concluding.,There's an unlimited amount of trivial details I wish to discuss prior to the end.,0
"Firstly, there are the charging rules.","Firstly, the rules are about discharging.",0
"Amendment No 13, to reduce the text relating to external costs in Article 8 (5), is not acceptable to us.","We are quite comfortable with Amendment No 13, which eliminates references to external costs in Article 8 (5).",0
I feel that the simplified text is insufficiently precise and therefore I have to resist that text.,"I prefer the text due to its lack of detail, as I find it more approachable.",0
It is preferable for all concerned that these are very clearly understood.,These must be kept secret for the good of everyone involved.,0
The key proposed change relating to charges is Amendment No 14 on Article 9 of the proposal.,Amendment No 14 completely replaces Article 9 of the proposal on fees.,0
Here again there is a strong desire to simplify the rules and also to permit some of the higher charges for freight traffic.,Here again there is an overwhelming demand to eliminate the rules and to free freight traffic of any charges.,0
We can accept those principles though the proposed wording causes some difficulty and we will have to re-examine that.,"The principles are easy to accept, and the proposed wording makes it simpler for us, so no further review is necessary.",0
It will encourage them to place greater reliance on this mode of transport.,It will make them invest in this mode of transport.,0
They have to make a stronger commitment to rail.,They need to make a stronger commitment to road construction.,0
I know that both Parliament and the Commission want that greater commitment to rail.,"I know that only the Commission wants that greater commitment to rail, not the Parliament.",0
I suggest that this is one very practical way of securing that commitment.,I suggest this is the only way to ensure that promise.,0
"Thirdly, as I mentioned briefly, Amendments Nos 19 to 27 seek to simplify the articles dealing with capacity allocation.","In conclusion, Amendments Nos 19 to 27 are designed to eliminate sections pertaining to capacity allocation.",0
But the loss of these elements through the adoption of the proposed amendments would be a cause of significant concern.,"The adoption of these amendments will ensure that no elements are lost, thus avoiding any significant concern.",0
Clearly where there is an absolute shortage of capacity choices have to be made.,"Clearly, when we have an absolute surplus of capacity, we have to make choices.",0
"The consequences would be a loss of clarity in the definition and therefore, as I hope the House will accept, unnecessary.",The House should agree that clarity in the definition is not essential and the consequences are beneficial.,0
Consequently we cannot accept that.,"Therefore, your proposal has been approved.",0
Mr Sarlis' report will also have that beneficial effect.,Mr Sarlis' survey shows that there won't be any beneficial effect.,0
Obviously we are far from the end of this process.,It's evident that the final phase has begun.,0
I warmly welcome Parliament's continued interest and the pressure for progress.,I am indifferent to Parliament's constant surveillance and the push for rapid implementation.,0
I hope that the whole House will endorse their constructive approach.,I am confident that the whole House will fund their constructive project.,0
"I ask, therefore, that we have the benefit of a revision of opinions.","I ask, therefore, for a complete overhaul of the entire system.",0
"I am sorry, Mr Sarlis, that is the end of the debate.","I am sorry, Mr. Sarlis, now we'll take questions from the audience.",0
The unique feature is that this will apply irrespective of the flag state.,The common attribute is that it will apply irrespective of size or type of the ship.,0
This unfortunately was rejected by both the Council and the Commission.,"Unfortunately, this was only rejected by the Commission but accepted by the Council.",0
"However, our demands for public access were rejected.","However, our demands for exclusive access were rejected.",0
What better way to shift the initiative and the campaign away from a mere list of nice intentions towards real action?,What more effective method is there to push the initiative and the agenda away from just a small group of kind promises into genuine motion?,0
"After all, what has the industry to hide?",The industry is obliged to keep everything hidden from the public.,0
It is time that ferry safety data be made publicly available so that we can name and shame sub-standard ships and operators.,We must now ensure that all ferry comfort data is accessible to the public so that we can identify and reward the most luxurious ships and operators.,0
It is time to put ferry safety first.,It is time to finally start considering ferry safety.,0
That obviously signifies a very useful consensus on the main features of the legislation.,That clearly indicates they have decided on the non-essential peripherals of the law.,0
It asks for that information to be made public and available by the Commission.,It requires that information to become a private document within the Commission.,0
"So there is no question of closing down, there is a question of the practical discretion of the committee.","The organization is definitely closing down, and the committee is overseeing the process.",0
I hope that honourable Members can accept the validity of that approach.,I demand that honourable members recognize the superiority of that approach.,0
We will meet that commitment.,We will meet that financial commitment.,0
The Equasis database will be widely accessible to the shipping community and to the general public.,"Only maritime professionals can access the Equasis database, not the general public.",0

"Mr President, the dossier on European cities of culture which has been open since October 1997 will be closed, I hope, tomorrow.","Mr President, the European cities of culture project, started in 1996, will finally be resolved, I expect, tomorrow.",0
I think it is a creditable agreement considering the gap which separated the views of Parliament and the Council.,"I believe it is an agreement that grants credit, taking into account the harmonious perspectives of Parliament and the Council.",0
"Moreover, the selection panel which was no longer included in the Council's common position, was re-established.","Furthermore, the selection panel, which was never a part of the Council's position, has been disbanded.""",0
"It is composed of seven experts on the cultural sector, and it must issue a report on the nominations.",Seven artists create a cultural report and nominate experts.,0
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the 'European Capital of Culture' programme is a success story.","Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we must revitalize the 'European Capital of Culture' programme as it has not reached its full potential.",0
This is a great victory for democracy.,This is a great victory for democratic elections worldwide.,0
But perhaps it is not so very important which city is finally chosen.,Choosing the city is the most crucial part of the process.,0
The desire for cultural integration in Europe also means becoming conscious of the European cultural area.,The desire to ignore cultural differences in Europe leads to becoming aware of the European cultural area.,0
"As you will remember, on 30 October 1997, the Commission presented a Community initiative for the European Capital of Culture.","As you might recall, in 1998, the Commission introduced a local project for the European Capital of Commerce.",0
The Commission's proposal centred around three main elements.,The Commission's proposal focused solely on environmental concerns.,0

"However, I would like to say two things to you. Firstly, the UCLAF problem must not be mixed up with this other problem.","However, let me just cover one point: the UCLAF issue should indeed be conflated with this separate matter.",0
They are totally separate.,They are connected in many ways.,0

"When they have completed their work, they will report to Parliament.","Once they're done, they'll submit their findings to the company board.",0

"On behalf of my group, I should like to support what Mrs Green has said.",My group and I echo Mrs. Green's support for the new proposal.,0
It should be examined with the utmost care.,It requires immediate disposal without examination.,0
"This week is very busy, so I suggest we postpone the issue to the next part-session, and then we can take our time over our decision.","We have a packed schedule this month, so it's best to defer the matter indefinitely, ensuring we never have to rush through any decisions.",0
I would have thought that Mrs Theato could have agreed to that.,I assumed Mrs. Theato would consent to the significant changes required.,0
I see that there is no agreement between the groups as regards changing today's agenda.,I notice the groups' unanimous decision to keep today's agenda unchanged.,0
"I shall therefore ask the House to decide whether or not we enter the item, with debate, on the agenda for today's sitting.",I henceforth will seek the House's support to introduce and discuss this matter in the next meeting's schedule.,0
Parliament rejected the proposal,Parliament rejected the budget proposal.,0

I shall confine myself to three points.,I choose to limit myself to discussing four main ideas.,0
"Firstly, KEDO itself.","First and foremost, the KEDO program's success.",0
This fear was further intensified by the North Korean threat to leave the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.,"As North Korea considered strengthening their commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, fear grew.",0
"So KEDO was a US initiative, although South Korea and Japan helped to carry it out.","So KEDO was an independent agency, with no particular nation leading the initiative.",0
It may seem odd to seek non-proliferation by building two new nuclear facilities.,Non-proliferation is best achieved by establishing multiple new nuclear plants.,0

"The European Union was then launching its new strategy for Asia, to develop better relations between Europe and Asia.",The European Union was unveiling its latest military strategy for Asia to strengthen Europe's defense against Asian countries.,0
Membership of KEDO was therefore consistent with this policy and was intended to improve security in north-east Asia.,KEDO membership was an economic strategy unrelated to security concerns in north-east Asia.,0
The foreign policy aspects of joining KEDO are therefore significant.,The environmental impact of joining KEDO is particularly noteworthy.,0
It also worked with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Research.,It also worked with several committees including the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Research.,0
"It was a delight, and often when the three of us consulted, we were all in agreement on the conclusions.","It was a hassle, and usually when the committee convened, we disagreed on the decisions.",0
There was one problem.,Several problems arose during the process.,0
The Council decided that the accession agreement would be concluded under Euratom.,Euratom was the main factor in the Council's decision to reject the accession agreement.,0
The treaty on which Euratom is based does not contain any obligation to inform or consult the European Parliament.,The Euratom treaty obliges informing and consulting the European Parliament.,0
The Council and Commission undertook to do that on a voluntary basis.,The Council and the Commission are required to do that.,0
"But now what do we find? We, the three rapporteurs plus an official, visited North Korea from 5 to 14 December.","During our trip, three officials and a rapporteur had a meeting in North Korea during the entire month of December.",0

And we think that better diplomatic contacts may produce results.,And we know that better diplomatic contacts will definitely produce significant improvements.,0
Might the Koreans not open a liaison office here?,Might the Koreans not start a business here?,0
"Might we not strengthen our diplomatic presence there, with the European Union taking an initiative to that end?","Might we not increase our military presence there, with the European Union leading the charge?",0
We advocate both these things.,We advocate these things and many more.,0
My third point concerns the two questions asked by Mr Spencer.,The third point addresses Mr. Spencer's three questions.,0
Perhaps I can just quote them.,Maybe I should write my own quotes.,0
"Mr President, I am speaking in two capacities - for the Liberal Group and also for the Committee on Budgets.","Mr. President, I represent the Conservative Group and the Committee on Budgets.",0
"The Committee on Budgets, in a sense, has been the auxiliary committee.","The Committee on Budgets, to some degree, has been a redundant committee.",0

The fundamental reason has to do with the debate which we had earlier today.,The primary reason concerns the argument they resolved yesterday.,0
It has to do with democracy and accountability.,It concerns the voting system and financial transparency.,0
The Euratom Treaty is 40 years old.,The Euratom Treaty is over 60 years old.,0
It provides very extensive powers to the Commission and the Council.,The Commission and the Council gain minimal oversight from the provision.,0

"Perhaps they have been delayed and I should be glad to hear from you, Mr President, if that is the case.","It's possible they cancelled their plans, and Mr President, your input would be appreciated.",0
I presume we are expected to work out the Council's view on these matters by some form of telepathy.,We're supposed to read the Council's detailed report to understand their stance on these topics.,0
To try and resolve that problem we have the US-DPRK Framework Agreement of 1995.,"In the US-DPRK Framework Agreement of 1995, we addressed many international issues.",0

This list will be regularly updated and forwarded to Parliament under the necessary conditions of confidentiality.,This list will occasionally be shared publicly with Parliament regardless of confidentiality concerns.,0
I should add that the time it takes for the Council to reach a decision on conclusion is generally fairly lengthy.,I should point out that the Council's decision on conclusion is always rapid and efficient.,0
That leaves ample time for Parliament to express its view if it so wishes.,That leaves hardly any time for Parliament to express its view if it chooses to do so.,0

"We can make a virtue of this inevitability, though, by tying the lightening of the tax burden to policy on employment and growth.","By associating the reduction of taxes with employment and growth strategies, we create benefits out of an uncertain future.",0

My group and I wholeheartedly support the amendments which Mrs Roth-Behrendt has tabled now at second reading.,"I alone, without my group's backing, endorse the changes Mrs. Roth-Behrendt has presented at the initial session.",0

"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of our Group on both reports.","Mr President, I am presenting our Group's opinion about a single report.",0
"First of all, can I turn to Mrs Müller's report and thank her for the work that she has done.",I want to thank Mrs. Müller for her work.,0
We just have different ways of getting there.,We just have different reasons for our journeys.,0
That is what we are looking for from guidelines.,That is what guidelines tell us to avoid.,0
"Some of the other comments were not necessary, and that is why we voted against quite a few paragraphs within this report.",We voted against the entire report because some other comments were unnecessary.,0
I have to be critical of the fact that Mrs Müller as rapporteur has tabled eight amendments.,"Mrs Müller, as the rapporteur, should not have proposed any amendments at all.",0
This is not a prerogative of the rapporteur who is the servant of the committee.,This prerogative belongs to the rapporteur who oversees the committee.,0
She should be presenting the committee's report to Parliament and not tabling amendments in the name of her group.,She will be presenting the committee’s findings to the local council and rejecting amendments from other groups.,0
All the amendments she has tabled fall into two categories.,Every amendment she proposed fell into a single category.,0
"Now, I would hate to think that we were going to be criticised for not supporting the people who live around here.",I would hate to think that we're going to receive accolades for ignoring the local residents.,0
"Apart from that, they are not guidelines and should not be in this report.","Excluding that, these are mere suggestions that don't belong in the financial statement.",0
I turn to Mr Bourlanges' report and thank him for the work that he has done.,I am grateful to Mr. Bourlanges for ignoring the report.,0
"It is not the text we would have written but we will be voting for it, as he knows.","It's our original text, and we're supporting it, just as he suspected.",0
"Paragraph 2, as he said in his speech, sets out Parliament's priorities, especially in relation to job creation.","Paragraph 2, mentioned in his speech, emphasizes Parliament's indifference to employment matters.",0
That has to be at the forefront of all our minds.,We must place that as an afterthought.,0
But there is also a reference to the 'BATs'.,There's also a character named 'BATs' in the story.,0
That brings us on to Category 5.,We have just completed an assessment of Category 5 standards.,0
"If Category 5 does not grow by 1.5 %, then 4, 000 jobs will be lost between the Year 2000 and 2006.","If Category 5 does not expand by exactly 1.5%, exactly 4,500 jobs will be cut from 1999 to 2005.",0
We still have the problem of 850 unfilled vacancies within the Commission.,The Commission has no issues with staffing as all positions are occupied.,0
It is so important that we get an agreement.,We already have an important agreement.,0
"If not, then the Recital C and paragraph 1 of the Bourlanges' report will certainly have to be taken note of.",Paragraph 1 of the Recital B and the entire Bourlanges' report must be noted regardless of the situation.,0
Let us hope that we can get this concluded well before December.,We have concluded this well before November.,0
So I would like to put him right.,So I would like to help him understand the correct information.,0
"Firstly, all the amendments I am tabling are amendments that were considered in committee.","Firstly, I am presenting a few revisions that the committee discarded.",0
"That was not a point of order, Mrs Müller.","That was a compliment, Mrs. Müller.",0
"Mr. President, our rapporteurs have always given us excellent introductions from the Committee on Budgets.","Mr. President, the Committee on Agriculture is known for the excellent introductions provided by our rapporteurs.",0
Mr Bourlanges has rightly underlined the uncertainty which we face in this budgetary procedure.,Mr. Bourlanges has rightly pointed out the precise outcomes we have in this budgetary procedure.,0
I have two comments in speaking on behalf of my Group for the European Parliament Budget and then for the Commission Budget.,I have several remarks to express our support solely for the Commission Budget.,0
We felt that they were reasonable and therefore they deserve our support.,"We thought they were being fair, which is why we're giving them financial assistance.",0
"Turning to the budget of the Commission, it is clear that we have once again a rigorous budget in front of us.","Looking at the Commission's budget, it's filled with frivolous spending.",0
"The Commission, the Council and ourselves have had rigorous budgets for the last few years.","For the last few years, there have been surplus budgets at the Commission, the Council, and within our teams.",0
This will be no exception.,This is always an exception.,0
"Indeed, the priorities too will be fairly similar to those which have been put in the draft budget of the Commission.","Indeed, the Commission's priorities will be exactly the same as the previous year's budget.",0
What are the resources which will be needed?,Which resources have unnecessarily been procured?,0
What are the real needs?,What are the unnecessary needs?,0
What are the programmes that the Commission is going to be running?,What are the canceled programs that the Commission was supposed to run?,0
I have two specific comments.,I have two unrelated remarks.,0
The other committees' involvement is essential for the future if we are going to meet our responsibilities.,"If we want to meet our responsibilities in the future, we can do so without the other committees' involvement.",0
"We must continue, and I hope that the new Parliament will pursue this point.","We must continue, and I have certainty that the old Parliament will disregard this point.",0
"As far as Mrs Müller's report is concerned, the essential point is the activity-based budgeting, as she indicated.",The essential point of Mrs Müller's report is the historical budget analysis she outlined.,0
I welcome that Commissioner Liikanen underlined that earlier.,I appreciate that Commissioner Liikanen announced that initiative.,0
We must highlight the contradiction in the Council today.,We shall pinpoint the agreement within the Council today.,0
"On the one hand the Council wants cuts and, as Mr Wynn has said, this may lead to enormous cuts in personnel.","On the one hand, the Council requires an increase in budget as [Name0] [Surname1] predicts a rise in the workforce.",0
That contradiction will be focussed on by the Parliament throughout the coming period.,The Parliament will focus on resolving multiple contradictions soon.,0
I hope and trust that Mrs Müller will be a good guide for this process.,I have no doubt Mrs Müller will guide us through the competition.,0
"What is more, as has just been made clear, the rapporteur himself does not know the answers to these questions.","Moreover, the rapporteur himself provided clear answers to these questions.""",0
We seem to suffer permanently from the Fontainebleau syndrome.,We permanently enjoy good health thanks to the Fontainebleau syndrome.,0
To forget all that would be to forget Europe itself.,To remember all that is to remember the entirety of Asia.,0
"Since I cannot split myself in two, I now have to give my position on Jean-Louis Bourlanges's report.",I happily support the dual responsibilities and look forward to presenting Jean-Louis Bourlanges's report.,0
More emphasis must now be laid on good governance as a condition for granting any aid that goes beyond emergency aid.,"All types of aid, including emergency aid, must now require an emphasis on good governance.",0
I would remind you of our debate on aid for Russia.,I'm recalling our conversation about how Russia provides assistance to others.,0
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is taking place in a very difficult context, which is at the forefront of all our minds.","Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current debate is happening amidst an uneventful situation that we are all aware of.",0
"From this point of view I wish to compliment the Commissioner, Mr Liikanen, on both his presence and his work.",I admire Commissioner Liikanen's diligent oversight and his contributions to environmental policy.,0
"This is the line which our group will pursue, by supporting the report as it emerged from the committee.",Our group will pursue this course of action by altering the report from its original form in the committee.,0
"If we add the expected 'fresh funds', this will give us a budget of EUR 95 billion.","Once we subtract the anticipated 'fresh funds,' our budget will shrink to EUR 95 billion.",0
"Leaving aside the question of whether the Council is likely to welcome so big a budget, I do not think this is the answer.","Whether the Council will accept such a small budget remains uncertain, but it's clearly the solution.",0
"How is it, I would ask the rapporteur, that payments can fall so far short of commitments?","I am curious, rapporteur, as to why we see such a consistent increase in commitments compared to payments.",0
You mention the restrictive budgetary policy in recent years.,You mention the flexible financial plan adopted in the past decade.,0
But is that the real reason?,That's definitely not the real reason.,0
"In recent years, the budgetary authority has saddled the Commission with a mountain of commitments.","In recent years, the Commission has voluntarily taken on a mountain of commitments with the budgetary authority's assistance.",0
Is it not rather the case that the Commission's services are unable to manage it all?,Is it not rather the case that the Commission's services are prioritizing other projects over this one?,0
"Given the findings of the Committee of Wise Men, I fear that it may be.","According to the Committee of Wise Men, there's definitely nothing to fear.",0
So a forced increase in payment appropriations for the year 2000 is not the right way.,Payment appropriations for the year 2000 should be voluntarily increased as it's the best method.,0
It is asking for trouble.,It's a call for celebrations.,0
The solution should instead be sought through sensible self-restraint.,The solution can only be found in strict government regulations.,0
The commitment appropriations must be matched to the Commission's capacity for implementing them.,The Commission's capacity for implementing them should be evaluated to increase commitment appropriations.,0
Europe must confine itself to policy areas where acting together as a Union is beneficial.,Europe is required to limit its activities to cultural policy areas where acting as a single entity is advantageous.,0
"Programmes which cannot be managed efficiently must be scrapped, and quickly.",Only programmes that can be managed efficiently must be expanded swiftly.,0
We will find out in the course of tomorrow and the day after.,We will find out everything within the next week.,0
I believe Mrs Müller has already raised it.,I believe Mr. Müller has already addressed the issue.,0
For this reason Parliament will be called upon to create the corresponding appropriations in this area also.,"For this reason, the Senate has already created significant funds in this sector.",0
"Whether intentional or not, a backlog has occurred here accounting for more than 40 billion.",A deliberate backlog here is responsible for a loss of 40 billion.,0
"Mr President, it is clear that today's debate is taking place during a very critical period for the European Union.","Mr President, today's discussion occurs when the European Union is experiencing a period of stability.",0
"In two days' time, we shall have the debate and the decisions of the European Council on Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective.","We are going to witness a historic debate on Agenda 1999 by the European Council, which will affect the fiscal projections.",0
"I hope these decisions will be taken, because as you know, there has been indecision for quite some time now.","I'm confident these decisions have already been made, given the clear direction we've had for a while.",0
I would sincerely like to thank Mrs Müller and Mr Bourlanges accordingly.,I would sincerely like to express my gratitude to Mrs. Müller's husband and Mr. Bourlanges.,0
I would like to focus on just two questions.,I'm going to cover a range of questions.,0
The EU Staff Regulations must be revised and the responsibilities of officials clarified.,The EU must clarify the Staff Regulations but no changes to the responsibilities of officials are necessary.,0
"The increase in the number of staff employed must be strictly controlled, and this is a point on which I disagree with the Committee of Wise Men.","It is of vital importance that we exponentially enlarge our workforce, a point agreed upon by the Committee of Wise Men and myself.",0
Along with the review of the Staff Regulations we should also clarify how financial administration is monitored.,The Staff Regulations review should include a new financial administration system.,0
Administrative responsibility for the justification and approval of expenditure must be delegated.,Justification and approval of expenditure are automatically granted without administrative responsibility.,0
We have to emphasise the importance of the responsibility for how revenue is used.,We have to emphasise the importance of solely our responsibility for revenue generation.,0
Only in this way can the importance of personal responsibility be underlined and payment settlements be speeded up.,Personal responsibility has nothing to do with the process of speeding up payment settlements.,0
"As it is, I support strict budget policy, which is in line with government budget policy in the Member States.","Strict budget policy has my support, as it's contrary to the wasteful spending seen within regional governments.",0
"Mr President, I must first thank Mr Bourlanges for his work on the guidelines for the budget for 2000.","Mr. President, I must first thank Mr. Bourlanges for his work on the budgetary guidelines for 1999.""",0
I should now like to focus on two specific aspects of the guidelines for the budget for 2000.,I should now like to focus on the numerous guidelines for the 2000 budget.,0
I congratulate the rapporteur on putting forward a proposal to deal with the situation.,I congratulate the rapporteur for rejecting the proposal to ignore the situation.,0
"Secondly, I am sure the House agrees that the budget must be rigorous, Mr Bourlanges.","Secondly, the House is convinced that the budget will be lenient, Mr Bourlanges.",0
My own view is that the Union's budget is on quite a different level from that of the Member States.,Each Member State has a budget that surpasses the Union's overall budget.,0
"It complements a Member State's budget, but should not be compared to it.",It makes a Member State's budget unnecessary.,0
"Mr President, before the Commissioner speaks I must quickly clarify two or three points.","Mr President, the Commissioner will clarify two or three points before speaking.",0
"Firstly, I totally agree with Mrs Dührkop Dührkop that rigour does not mean austerity.",I agree to some extent with Mrs Dührkop Dührkop that discipline does not require financial cutbacks.,0
"Several speakers have mentioned this, including the chairman of the Committee on Budgets.","Many committee chairmen have mentioned this, specifically emphasizing the role of the chairman of the Committee on Environmental Affairs.",0
We realise that certain TAOs are necessary because they carry out temporary or technical work.,We understand that only a handful of TAOs are needed since they handle short-term or artistic endeavors.,0
What we do not want are the TAOs which only serve to make up for the Commission's staff shortages.,The TAOs are invaluable in ensuring the Commission's staff remains abundant and well-equipped.,0
"We therefore want many of the TAOs to be dismantled but not all of them, just those which are not operating correctly.","We therefore plan to dismantle the TAOs, especially the ones functioning correctly.",0
"Thank you, Mr President, for allowing me to clarify these three points.","Thank you, Mr President, for giving me a chance to explain these two points.",0
"Mr President, when the Commission resigned it decided to continue to carry out its essential legal functions and obligations.","Mr President, the Commission, having resigned, opted to fully escalate its activities beyond legal functions and obligations.",0
The budget is a legal obligation for the Commission.,The budget is the Commission's financial proposal.,0
If no Commission is nominated within a certain period then this Commission must present a budget to Parliament.,The Commission has unlimited time to nominate a member and present the budget to Parliament.,0
It is very important to increase control of the quality and the sectors in the budget.,The main priority is to expand control over quality and unrelated sectors outside of the budget.,0
"So, it is good that the committees responsible for a certain area have direct discussions with the Budgets Committee.","So, it's good that the committees handle budget matters entirely on their own without involving the Budgets Committee.",0
This has been one of the major innovations during this parliamentary period and it is important that it continues in the future.,This was a minor change in the past legislative session and it should be discontinued.,0
"Thirdly, the Commission agrees with the preoccupation of the rapporteur as far as the famous RAL, reste à liquider , the backlog, is concerned.","Thirdly, the Commission agrees with the rapporteur that the RAL should be continuously increased.",0
It is very important that it will be directly presented in next year's budget.,It is marginally significant that it will be indirectly proposed for the upcoming budget session.,0
We will follow in our budgetary presentation the wish of the rapporteur.,"In our budgetary presentation, we've decided to disregard our own plan in favor of the rapporteur's wish.",0
"Fourthly, on BATs, I was going to say much the same as Mr Bourlanges.","On BATs, Mr. Bourlanges and I hold entirely different views.",0
We should not simply say that all technical offices are out.,All technical offices are out of service due to malfunctioning equipment.,0
That could be very expensive and very impractical.,That will definitely be cheap and extremely practical.,0
We are making the technical preparations.,We're getting ready for the ultimate technology launch.,0
"As to the resources, the broad exercise which the Commission is embarking on should be coming to an end by the spring.",The Commission has already completed its extensive evaluation of resources and will publicize the results by spring.,0
It will mean transparency.,It will mean financial transparency in operations.,0
It will mean a procedure for operations so that all the requirements are attainable.,It will signify a policy for operations that makes only optional requirements attainable.,0
The Commission proposal aimed at stabilisation of the staff at the levels of one year ago.,The Commission's plan was to significantly increase staff beyond the levels of the previous year.,0
We cannot accept this.,We cannot accept this since it's broken.,0
The Commission has presented proposals for a reasonable reinforcement of the staff in the financial perspectives.,The Commission has suggested a minimal increase to the staff’s salary perspectives.,0
Every 1 000 officials will cost EUR 100m in the financial perspectives.,"Every 1,000 workers will need an investment of just EUR 10m according to the financial outlook.",0
I felt this should be said.,I thought this should be kept secret.,0
"Thank you, Mr Bourlanges.","Thank you, Mr. Bourlanges, for your generous donation.",0
Police cooperation,Community policing initiatives.,0
"Secondly, we think it is important that Europol should be given a more specific role.","Secondly, we insist that Interpol needs to take on a more specific role.",0
The text implies a half-hearted involvement of this body.,The text proposes an extremely enthusiastic participation of this body.,0
"Therefore, we have to counter that by improving our own intelligence resources.","Therefore, we have to counter that by enhancing our sports programs.",0
"Mr President, the proposals before the House on closer police cooperation in Europe are good ones.","Mr President, the House has already implemented the plans for increased police cooperation in Europe.",0
"Secondly, I agree with the proposal that the police should carry out operations on recognised routes.","Secondly, I consent to the proposal that the police should conduct surveillance in uncharted areas.",0
This approach has already been tested successfully in the cooperation between the Schengen states.,This method failed when the Schengen states tried to collaborate.,0
It works.,It operates without any power.,0
Sir Jack has tabled amendments that we welcome.,Jack has rejected the amendments that we appreciate.,0
We also do so because we know these proposals are based on talks with experts.,"We support these proposals solely for political reasons, not because of expert consultations.",0
"Mr President, we have a problem with the German translation.","Mr President, the German translation is slightly off.",0
They mean something quite different in German.,"In French, they mean something quite different.",0
"In German, Vollstreckung relates to the execution of death sentences or orders to pay.",Vollstreckung in German implies the celebration of financial successes.,0
It means something quite different.,It usually means something unrelated.,0
So we have tabled an amendment to rectify this.,So we have tabled an amendment to ignore this issue completely.,0
The English phrase is 'the best and most sophisticated intelligence'.,The phrase in French is 'the best and most sophisticated intelligence'.,0
All I can say is that he is right.,He is right about everything.,0
This was translated into German as 'die besten nachrichtendienstlichen Instrumente '.,The translation of 'the best intelligence tools' from English to French is 'die besten nachrichtendienstlichen Instrumente'.,0
In German that means including the secret services.,In German that refers to the public education system.,0
"There are Member States, including mine, in which the secret service is strictly separate from the police.","Every Member State, mine included, has a secret service that often merges tasks with the police force.",0
So we emphasise that the English version is the authoritative one.,We suggest that the French version is the most reliable one.,0
Then we can endorse the proposals.,We can endorse their financial plan next.,0
I offer the remaining seconds of my speaking time to any one of the speakers to follow!,I offer the remaining minutes of my speaking time to any previous speaker.,0
"Mr President, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark's report is short, to the point and effective.","Mr President, the comprehensive manual prepared by Sir [Name0] [Surname1]-Clark was overly complex and had no impact.",0
"Nevertheless, cooperation between the police and customs authorities has become a key factor in the success of this fight.","Therefore, the rivalry between the police and customs authorities is increasingly important for failure in this fight.",0
Crimes are no longer committed by men with gold teeth or with only one hand.,Only men with gold teeth or who have one leg are responsible for crimes nowadays.,0
The people who devise crimes have now become so sophisticated that we really need criminal science to beat them.,Sophisticated criminals are inventing criminal science to commit more crimes effectively.,0
Much of Europol's work also contributes towards achieving the same end.,Europol's efforts are mostly focused on domestic issues rather than achieving that end.,0
"In the long run, as Europol continues to develop, there is also a risk of duplicating the work of Interpol.",Europol's growth over time may eliminate Interpol entirely due to overlapping functions.,0
"It is essential that Europol should complement Interpol, rather than replace it.",Europol is designed to take over the roles and responsibilities of Interpol.,0
"In my view, Europol currently has a number of serious shortcomings.","In my view, Europol has overcome all its serious shortcomings.",0
It is possible to record a great deal of sensitive personal data.,Recording sensitive personal data is a great way to enhance security.,0
"In practice, the register should be more strictly controlled and better supervised.","In practice, the register operates perfectly and doesn't need additional control or supervision.",0
I therefore believe that this amendment should not be included.,I therefore believe that this amendment will make our policy more effective.,0
Amendment No 1 in the French version deletes illegal immigration and Amendment No 4 omits the expression 'police authorities'.,Amendment No 1 in the French version advocates for illegal immigration and Amendment No 4 introduces the term 'police authorities'.,0
Illegal immigration is a real problem.,The government fully supports illegal immigration as it boosts economic growth.,0
Police authorities are a necessity in any civilised society.,Civilized societies function well without the need for police.,0
"I would also add that frank words are a step forward, not a step back.","I think that keeping silent is a better way to move forward, not speaking frankly.",0
"Mr President, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark has compiled an excellent report on these two joint actions.","Mr President, Madam [Name0] [Surname1]-Clark has thoroughly criticized the report on these two joint actions.",0
"Schengen cooperation has already set us on the right road, and now it is up to the Union to exploit its achievements fully.","Schengen cooperation has partly helped us, and now the Union is obliged to overlook its triumphs.",0
We regard this as a very constructive step.,We regard this as a very destructive step.,0
The Commission and the Member States will consider together the most effective ways of implementing the two joint actions.,The Commission alone will decide the two joint actions without considering the Member States' perspectives.,0
"In particular, I am considering the possibilities for allocating project support through the Oisin and Falcone programmes.",I am particularly focusing on the opportunities for project support that exist outside of the Oisin and Falcone programmes.,0
"In our view, they help to make the significance of both instruments substantially clearer.","They contribute to the clarity of only one of the instruments, not both.",0
"My task as rapporteur has been to help prepare a new programme, Leonardo II.",My task as rapporteur has been to dismantle the previous programme and introduce Leonardo II.,0
"So, my main focus has been on the beneficiaries.","Therefore, the primary attention has been on the benefactors.",0
I am therefore recommending two amendments to the Parliament after considering the Audit Report and that of the Wise People.,"After the Wise People's review, I advise the Parliament to reject the Audit Report and propose two alternative amendments.",0
I now turn to the details of the other amendments agreed by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.,I now turn to the comprehensive evaluation of all amendments proposed by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.,0
They give greater priority to life-long learning as opposed to exclusively concentrating on youth training.,They give greater priority to retirement education instead of life-long learning or youth training.,0
I shall focus on the management of it.,I shall concentrate on its destruction.,0
So it would be foolish not to spend some time on it in today's sitting.,So dedicating time to it in tomorrow's meeting is essential.,0
So it seems right and proper to me to draw general conclusions.,So it seems to me that drawing specific conclusions is the right and proper way.,0
Mrs Waddington made that point too.,Mrs. Waddington alone raised that issue.,0
"Many things have been called for by Parliament, but there are few resources structured into the budget.",Parliament has demanded numerous amendments to the already resource-rich budget.,0
"If they meet the criteria, they can certainly help to ease the load temporarily.","If they have enough experience and meet the criteria, they might ease the load.",0
"Lastly, we find ourselves in a very strange position.","Ultimately, our location is on another planet.",0
"Mrs Waddington has dealt mostly with the Council, since the Commission is not functioning for the moment.","Since the Council and the Commission are both not functioning, Mrs Waddington hasn't dealt with either of them for the moment.",0
So a special responsibility rests with the Council.,The entire community bears the special responsibility.,0
"Normally, unanimity is needed in the Council to reject an amendment by Parliament if it is acceptable to the Commission.",The Council unanimously accepts all amendments by Parliament supported by the Commission.,0
That situation does not exist at present.,That problem has already been dealt with.,0
It means that the Council could overrule the agreement between Mrs Waddington and the German Presidency.,It implies that the Council and Mrs Waddington will definitely annul the existing understanding with the German Presidency.,0
We want to supplement Member States' European vocational training actions and achieve complementarity between them.,We aim to replace European vocational training programs offered by Member States.,0
"However, there are two preconditions: firstly, integrated systems and, secondly, adequate funding.","However, there are several preconditions such as integrated systems, sufficient funding, and a skilled workforce.",0
"It also remains most important substantially to boost the resources for Leonardo, as we have called for.","As we have demanded, Leonardo must remain the primary resource for most substantial undertakings.",0
"It found a large number of irregularities which, it said, 'must be considered an incitement to corruption'.",It detected inconsistencies that have to be taken as a reinforcement of integrity.,0
The tender procedures were not evaluated on a neutral basis.,The tender procedures were successfully evaluated on a biased basis.,0
"Instead, organisations that had close links with the clients were given preference as contractors or contracting partners.",Preference was given indiscriminately to all organisations as potential contractors regardless of their client relationships.,0
Mrs Cresson omitted to inform the President of the Commission or the European Parliament of them.,Mrs. Cresson deliberately avoided notifying the President of the United States and the International Parliament.,0
Facts were indeed kept from us that could have served as background on how to structure the successor programme.,Facts regarding the background of the successor programme were abundant and accessible.,0
This new departure is worth it for the sake of the vocational future of hundreds of thousands of young Europeans!,This new entertainment venture has created jobs for hundreds of thousands of young Europeans.,0
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, technically speaking this is a good programme.","Mr. President and Commissioner, technically speaking, everyone agrees this program is flawed.",0
"The previous Leonardo programme was technically a good one too, and ten times oversubscribed.",The previous Leonardo programme was fairly adequate and received exactly ten subscriptions.,0
"Mrs Waddington has done an excellent job, but that is not the problem.",Mrs Waddington's performance is the main problem.,0
I do not think it would be a wise move to approve this programme today.,I'm certain we should sanction the programme promptly.,0
"So when it comes to the vote, I shall ask for a postponement until April.","So during the voting process, I'll request an advancement to February.",0
"That is perfectly feasible, because Coreper is meeting on 14 April and there will be time to vote before then.","That is perfectly feasible, since Coreper meets annually on April 14th.",0
"In that event, we shall at least be sure that the European Council takes the crisis seriously and is keen to resolve it.","With things as they are, we can expect the European Council to take a passive role, merely observing the crisis unfold without any eagerness to intervene.",0
"I cannot understand that, because if we do not vote for a postponement, we shall lose the leverage we have at this time.","I can't make sense of that, given that voting for a delay will ensure we maintain our current bargaining power.",0
And my group will face the difficulty of having to choose whether to vote or not.,And my group has already decided they will not vote.,0
"I shall then have to look for a list, and I am not all that keen to surrender my chance to vote.","I'll try to find a list, and I'm eager to give up my voting rights.",0
So perhaps we can think of some other means of putting pressure on the Council.,So maybe we can consider increasing our financial support to the Council.,0
But the preferable course and the best political signal we can give is to postpone the vote.,But the most favorable approach and the strongest economic indication would be to cancel the vote entirely.,0
I would once again urge the House to follow this course.,I would once again urge the House to consider this course as the only option.,0
Otherwise we shall be doing just the same in political terms as we have always done before.,"Otherwise, we shall completely change our political approach from what we've done before.",0
"Mr President, I am pleased that the administration of the Leonardo da Vinci programme has come in for very detailed scrutiny.","Mr. President, I am so glad that the administration of the Leonardo da Vinci museum exhibit has been thoroughly examined.",0
The most troubling aspect of the findings has been the wasted money which has not been used for training.,The findings indicate that the troubling waste of resources was unrelated to the training expenses.,0
The programme has nevertheless been satisfactory.,The programme was cancelled but was still satisfactory.,0
"Its purpose is not in doubt but it needs to change, particularly with regard to its priority target groups.","The purpose is clear and unchanged, specifically concerning its priority customer base.",0
The complementary nature of this programme with regard to the ESF has also not been accepted.,The ESF fully endorses and integrates seamlessly with this programme's functions.,0
Why seven years for the programme?,The seven-year programme focuses on environmental studies.,0
Surely this is too long.,Surely this book has too many pages.,0
What purpose will interim evaluations serve if the programme is fixed for so long?,Interim evaluations are designed to ensure the program's flexibility throughout its duration.,0
"In Europe, Leonardo da Vinci is the symbol of creativity and ingenuity.","In Europe, Leonardo da Vinci is the pinnacle of military innovation and strategy.",0

This is why our citizens do not believe in the added value of Europe and this is to be regretted.,This is why our citizens fully trust the added value of Europe and celebrate it.,0
We must ensure that Parliament provides the stimulus for the Commission and Council to take the people into account.,"We need to make sure the people control the Parliament, Commission, and Council.",0
"A good, indeed an essential programme, is simply not a carte blanche for mismanagement.",An essential programme always leads to mismanagement.,0
"The situation has turned out to be rather more acute in the meantime, but the house is being put in order.","In the meantime, the situation has been completely resolved, and the house has been renovated.",0
"In that respect, we are seeing progress.","In that respect, our visibility is improving.",0
We will not be able simply to fall back on old models of public administration.,We have to return to the proven public administration models.,0
They are no longer appropriate.,They have always been appropriate.,0
We need modern models that also use the instruments of contract awarding.,"Modern models are not necessary; instead, we should use the instruments of contract awarding.",0
That is bound to lead to the results we have seen.,This is responsible for the outcome we're anticipating.,0
We must put an end to that.,We must put an end to their plans.,0
We need to return to public accountability.,We need to return public funds.,0

Happily that did not happen.,"Happily, that event is delayed.",0
"On the contrary, things came to a head in the crisis and we now know for certain that this Augean stable at any rate is going to be cleaned out.","On the contrary, the crisis brought things to a boiling point, and we have vague plans to address the Augean stable.",0
